&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;No. 25A457 (25–5928)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;_________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;ANTHONY BOYD &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; JOHN Q. HAMM, COMMIS-SIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on application for stay and on petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[October 23, 2025]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The application for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Thomas&lt;/span&gt; and by him referred to the Court is denied. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt;, with whom &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Kagan&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt; join, dissenting from the denial of application for stay and denial of certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Take out your phone, go to the clock app, and find the stopwatch.  Click start.  Now watch the seconds as they climb.  Three seconds come and go in a blink.  At the thirty-second mark, your mind starts to wander.  One minute passes, and you begin to think that this is taking a long time.  Two . . . three . . . . The clock ticks on.  Then, finally, you make it to four minutes.  Hit stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Now imagine for that entire time, you are suffocating.  You want to breathe; you have to breathe.  But you are strapped to a gurney with a mask on your face pumping your lungs with nitrogen gas.  Your mind knows that the gas will kill you.  But your body keeps telling you to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; That is what awaits Anthony Boyd tonight.  For two to four minutes, Boyd will remain conscious while the State of Alabama kills him in this way.  When the gas starts flowing, he will immediately convulse.  He will gasp for air.  And  he will thrash violently against the restraints holding him in place as he experiences this intense psychological torment until he finally loses consciousness.  Just short of twenty minutes later, Boyd will be declared dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Boyd asks for the barest form of mercy: to die by firing squad, which would kill him in seconds, rather than by a torturous suffocation lasting up to four minutes.  The Constitution would grant him that grace.  My colleagues do not.  This Court thus turns its back on Boyd and on the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment"&gt;Eighth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;’s guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.  Because the Court should have instead granted a stay of execution and Boyd’s petition for certiorari, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Nitrogen hypoxia is a new method of execution.  To carry out an execution using this method, prison officials force a condemned person to inhale pure nitrogen gas, which displaces the oxygen in that person’s lungs.  Robbed of air in this way, the body’s instinctual urge to breathe kicks in.  At the same time, the mind understands that breathing will result in death.  The process takes around 20 minutes from start to completion.  See App. 36a–42a (recounting prior nitrogen hypoxia executions taking between 16 and 23 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Five States have authorized nitrogen hypoxia as a form of execution, though only Alabama and Louisiana have used it to carry out executions so far.  Before its implementation, the method was touted by Alabama and other States as a more “humane” alternative to lethal injection because it was supposedly “painless” and would result in unconsciousness within “seconds.”  Response in Opposition to Application for Stay in &lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hamm&lt;/em&gt;, O. T. 2023, No. 23–6562, etc., pp. 3, 21; &lt;em&gt;Dunn&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Price&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/929"&gt;587 U. S. 929&lt;/a&gt;, 930–931 (2019) (Breyer, J., dissenting from grant of application to vacate stay).  Yet even before Alabama undertook the first  execution using nitrogen hypoxia in early 2024, serious concerns were raised about the veracity of these claims.  See &lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hamm&lt;/em&gt;, 601 U. S. ___, ___–___, ___ (2024) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt;, J., dissenting from denial of application for stay and denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 1–2, 4).  Moreover, the method’s “details [we]re hazy” because Alabama released only a “heavily redacted protocol” describing the process.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at ___ (slip op., at 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Today, we have an actual record of nitrogen hypoxia’s use.  Together, Alabama and Louisiana have executed seven people using the method, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a (App.); &lt;em&gt;Hoffman&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Westcott&lt;/em&gt;, 604 U. S. ___ (2025), and the firsthand accounts from those executions reveal that nitrogen hypoxia is not at all what it was promised to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Start with Kenneth Eugene Smith, the first person to be executed using nitrogen hypoxia in our country’s history.  When the nitrogen gas started flowing, Smith made “ ‘violent movements’ ” immediately as he “ ‘gasp[ed] for . . . air.’ ”  App. 36a.  His “feet and head left the gurney [and] his arms appeared to strain against his restraints.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  Smith convulsed for about two to four minutes, shaking the gurney several times.  His wife testified that it was like “ ‘watching someone drown without water.’ ”  Petitioner’s Post-Hearing Brief in No. 25–cv–00529 (ND Ala., Sept. 11, 2025), ECF Doc. 87, p. 3.  Smith’s spiritual advisor, who has witnessed at least five lethal-injection executions, remarked afterward that “ ‘[w]e didn’t see somebody go unconscious in 30 seconds.  What we saw was minutes of somebody struggling for his life.  We saw minutes of someone heaving back and forth.  We saw spit.  We saw all sorts of stuff develop from his mask.’ ”&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  He emphasized that “[i]t was the most horrible  thing” he had “ever seen.”&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Smith was pronounced dead 18 minutes after the execution started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The State largely blamed Smith for staying conscious.  It insisted that his convulsing was primarily because he held his breath and fought the execution process.  See App. 37a, and n. 24; &lt;em&gt;Miller&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Marshall&lt;/em&gt;, No. 2:24–cv–197 (MD Ala., July 15, 2024), ECF Doc. 70, pp. 1–2, 14–21.  Subsequent executions, however, show that Smith was certainly not the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Aiden Miller was executed next.  When the execution began, Miller’s “ ‘whole body started to shake very intensely,’ ” App. 38a, with “ ‘violent convulsions,’ ” ECF Doc. 87, at 6.  He “ ‘gasped, shook[,] and struggled against his restraints,’ ”  App. 38a, with his eyes open the entire time.  ECF Doc. 87, p. 6.  Miller was pronounced dead after sixteen minutes.  Then came Carey Dale Grayson: For four minutes, he shook “ ‘his head vigorously,’ ” “ ‘struggled[  ] while clearly still breathing,’ ” and raised both of his legs far off the gurney as he pushed against the restraints.  App. 39a–40a.  Grayson was pronounced dead after 16 minutes.  This pattern has held steady during the State’s subsequent executions of Demetrius Frazier, Gregory Hunt, and Geoffrey West, as witnesses have reported similar observations each time: apparent consciousness for minutes, not seconds; and violent convulsing, eyes bulging, consistent thrashing against the restraints, and clear gasping for the air that will not come.&lt;em&gt;  Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 34a, 41a–42a.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Yet, the State has continued to defend the executions as constitutionally permissible despite a readily available alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt; II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Boyd challenged Alabama’s use of nitrogen hypoxia under the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment"&gt;Eighth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; and asked that the State execute him by firing squad instead.  The District Court denied Boyd’s request for a preliminary injunction barring his execution by nitrogen hypoxia.  The Eleventh Circuit denied a stay on the sole ground that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Boyd’s &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment"&gt;Eighth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; claim lacked merit.  That was error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Under &lt;em&gt;Bucklew &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Precythe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/119"&gt;587 U. S. 119 (2019)&lt;/a&gt;, whether a method of execution violates the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment"&gt;Eighth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; turns, in main part, on whether it imposes a “superadd[ition] of terror, pain, or disgrace.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 119, 133 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Baze &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Rees&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/553/35"&gt;553 U. S. 35&lt;/a&gt;, 48 (2008) (plurality opinion); internal quotation marks omitted).  To establish that the “State’s chosen method of execution cruelly superadds pain to the death sentence,” &lt;em&gt;Bucklew&lt;/em&gt; instructs that “a prisoner must show a feasible and readily implemented alternative method of execution that would significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain and that the State has refused to adopt without a legitimate penological reason.”  587 U. S., at 134.  &lt;em&gt;Bucklew&lt;/em&gt; did not distinguish between mental and physical anguish in setting forth this standard.  For good reason: As recognized for centuries, a form of punishment can be “cruel” if “ ‘[d]isposed to give pain to others, in body or &lt;em&gt;mind&lt;/em&gt;.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 130 (quoting 1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828); emphasis added); see &lt;em&gt;Watts&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Indiana&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/338/49"&gt;338 U. S. 49&lt;/a&gt;, 52 (1949) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.) (“There is torture of mind as well as body; the will is as much affected by fear as by force.  And there comes a point where this Court should not be ignorant as judges of what we know as men”).  Here, Boyd identified the firing squad as an alternative method by which to evaluate the comparative pain imposed by nitrogen hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  Before the District Court, the parties presented evidence at a two-day hearing.  The District Court then made the following determinations critical to its analysis.  First, the District Court found, and the parties agreed, that “agonal breathing,” which occurs when an individual is close to death and is often characterized by “gasping, muscle jerks, and grunting,” is not itself sufficient evidence of pain because it can be involuntary and occur when a person is unconscious.  App. 43a–44a.  But the experts on both sides also agreed that severe psychological pain endures after the nitrogen gas is turned on and lasts until a loss of consciousness occurs.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 51a–52a.  As the District Court saw it, the “key question” was therefore “how long it will take” for a person to lose consciousness during the execution, and the court accepted for the sake of its analysis that this period typically lasts for two minutes, but has extended to four minutes in a prior execution.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 52a.  The District Court further clarified that even if this period lasted for seven minutes, its conclusion on Boyd’s &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment"&gt;Eighth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; claim would not change.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 53a, n. 34.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Second, the District Court found that to minimize the duration of conscious suffering, the individual must cooperate in his execution.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 55a–56a.  Holding one’s breath or taking short breaths, often the products of an involuntary reaction to oxygen depletion, prolongs consciousness.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Third, the District Court found that a firing squad would render someone unconscious in three to six seconds.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 64a.  Still, the court noted, this period would involve &lt;em&gt;physical &lt;/em&gt;pain, whereas nitrogen hypoxia would likely inflict &lt;em&gt;psychological&lt;/em&gt; pain alone.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  The Eleventh Circuit, for its part, did not rely on this distinction between physical and psychological pain, instead accepting for the sake of argument that nitrogen hypoxia does inflict physical pain too.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 11a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; On these findings and assumptions, Boyd more than made his case, under &lt;em&gt;Bucklew&lt;/em&gt;, that nitrogen hypoxia likely  poses a substantial risk of conscious terror and psychological pain and that the firing squad is a sufficient alternative.  The District Court, however, justified its contrary conclusion by drawing a false equivalence.  In its view, prisoners facing death by nitrogen hypoxia, like all prisoners facing execution, experience distress knowing that death is near.  See App. 62a–64a.  As a result, distress is an “unavoidable consequenc[e] of capital punishment under any method of execution.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 62a&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  That the distress continues when the gas is turned on is therefore unremarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; That analysis is blind to the reality of what will happen to Boyd in this execution chamber and the additional and unnecessary psychological terror he will experience.  Boyd will, of course, experience the same distress that all condemned men suffer in anticipation of their execution by the State.  The claim here, however, is that, on top of that ordinary, anticipatory distress, nitrogen hypoxia will profoundly add to Boyd’s suffering &lt;em&gt;after &lt;/em&gt;the execution begins and while it is being carried out to completion.  As the District Court assumed, it takes at least two, and could take up to seven, full minutes for someone to lose consciousness—that is, up to seven full minutes of conscious, excruciating suffocation.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 52a–55a.  As the State’s expert admitted, “a person consciously experiencing the ‘primal urge to breathe’ ” during those two to seven minutes “while knowing that breathing will cause death amounts to severe emotional suffering.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 51a.  This superadded psychological torment is both unique to nitrogen hypoxia and goes well beyond what is inherent in any constitutional method of execution.  Cf. &lt;em&gt;Baze&lt;/em&gt;, 553 U. S., at 53 (plurality opinion) (noting that a substantial risk of suffocation violates the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment"&gt;Eighth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; A similar error led the District Court to reject the firing squad as an adequate alternative to nitrogen hypoxia—even while determining that it was “feasible” and could be “readily implemented.”  App. 66a.  According to the District  Court, death by firing squad would not “significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain” posed by nitrogen hypoxia because the same anticipatory psychological pain would occur before the execution by firing squad, while the firing squad would add a risk of physical pain after the shots are fired.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.; see&lt;em&gt; id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 63a–64a.  Again, however, the District Court ignored that, under its own assumptions, nitrogen hypoxia would superadd up to seven minutes of psychological pain beyond the ordinary anticipatory distress of an execution.  Once the execution starts, a firing squad would render someone unconscious in three to six seconds; nitrogen hypoxia, on the other hand, lasts for minutes.  See&lt;em&gt; id&lt;/em&gt;., at 55a, 64a.  There is a significant constitutional difference between three to six &lt;em&gt;seconds&lt;/em&gt; of physical pain and terror and two to seven &lt;em&gt;minutes&lt;/em&gt; of conscious suffocation with its associated psychological pain and terror.  In gross numerical terms, nitrogen hypoxia risks extending the period of terror up to 140-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Although it is deeply troubling to weigh the associated pain posed by the two different methods against each other, this “comparative exercise” is demanded by the Court’s recent precedents.  See &lt;em&gt;Bucklew&lt;/em&gt;, 587 U. S., at 136.  Perhaps this unease reflects problems with its doctrinal foundation. See &lt;em&gt;Glossip&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Gross&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/863"&gt;576 U. S. 863&lt;/a&gt;, 970–975 (2015) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt;, J., dissenting).  So long as the requirement persists, however, courts must engage in this macabre weighing.  Here, the District Court and the Eleventh Circuit failed to recognize the significant differences between the two methods of execution despite the factual record before them.  Because Boyd demonstrated that he was likely to succeed on his &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment"&gt;Eighth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; claim, this Court should have granted a stay of execution and his petition for certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt; *  *  *&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment"&gt;Eighth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; “does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death.”  &lt;em&gt;Bucklew&lt;/em&gt;, 587 U. S., at 132.  But when a State introduces an experimental method of execution that superadds psychological terror as a necessary feature of its successful completion, courts should enforce the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment"&gt;Eighth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;’s mandate against cruel and unusual punishment.  Allowing the nitrogen hypoxia experiment to continue despite mounting and unbroken evidence that it violates the Constitution by inflicting unnecessary suffering fails to “ ‘protec[t] [the] dignity’ ” of “ ‘the Nation we have been, the Nation we are, and the Nation we aspire to be.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt;, 601 U. S., at ___ (opinion of &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt;, J.) (slip op., at 5) (quoting &lt;em&gt;Hall&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Florida&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/572/701"&gt;572 U. S. 701&lt;/a&gt;, 708 (2014)).  Seven people have already been subjected to this cruel form of execution.  The Court should not allow Boyd to become the eighth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Dissent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;_________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;No. 25A319&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;_________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; ASHTON ORR, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on application for stay&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[November 6, 2025]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This case concerns an Executive Branch policy requiring all new passports to display an individual’s biological sex at birth.  The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts preliminarily enjoined the Government from enforcing the policy, and the First Circuit declined to stay the injunction pending appeal.  The Government then filed this stay application.  Applying our familiar stay factors at this preliminary stage, we grant the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth—in both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment.  And on this record, respondents have failed to establish that the Government’s choice to display biological sex “lack[s] any purpose other than a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group.”  &lt;em&gt;Trump&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hawaii&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/667"&gt;585 U. S. 667&lt;/a&gt;, 705 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nor are respondents likely to prevail in arguing that the State Department acted arbitrarily and capriciously by declining to depart from Presidential rules that Congress expressly required it to follow.  See &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/211a"&gt;22 U. S. C. §211a&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For these reasons, the Government is likely to succeed on the merits.  And the District Court’s grant of class-wide relief enjoins enforcement of an Executive Branch policy with foreign affairs implications concerning a Government document.  In light of the foregoing, the Government will  “suffer[ ] a form of irreparable injury” absent a stay.  &lt;em&gt;Trump &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;CASA, Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/606/831"&gt;606 U. S. 831&lt;/a&gt;, 861 (2025) (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The application for stay presented to &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt; and by her referred to the Court is granted.  The June 17, 2025 order of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, case No. 1:25–cv–10313, is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari, if such a writ is timely sought.  Should certiorari be denied, this stay shall terminate automatically.  In the event certiorari is granted, the stay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt;, with whom &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Kagan&lt;/span&gt; join, dissenting from the grant of application for stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As is becoming routine, the Government seeks an emergency stay of a District Court’s preliminary injunction pending appeal.  As is also becoming routine, this Court misunderstands the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Our task in deciding stay applications is not simply to make a “back-of-the-napkin assessment of which party has the better legal argument.”  &lt;em&gt;Noem&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Doe&lt;/em&gt;, 605 U. S. ___, ___ (2025) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Jackson&lt;/span&gt;, J., dissenting from grant of stay) (slip op., at 3).  Rather, the actual nub of the project (if we choose to involve ourselves in the matter at all) is to fairly determine whether the applicant’s showing justifies our extraordinary intervention.  To do this, we consider not only the applicant’s likelihood of success on the merits, but also whether the applicant will suffer irreparable harm absent emergency intervention, as well as the relative harm to the parties and the public interest in the grant or denial of a stay.  See &lt;em&gt;Nken&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Holder&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/418"&gt;556 U. S. 418&lt;/a&gt;, 434 (2009).  Here, the balance-of-the-equities factor requires weighing the harm to the Government from not being able to proceed immediately with its allegedly unlawful policy against the harm to the individuals who would be subjected to that policy.  See &lt;em&gt;Williams&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Zbaraz&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/442/1309"&gt;442 U. S. 1309 (1979)&lt;/a&gt; (Stevens, J., in chambers).  Balancing the equities is an important part of the analysis because it avoids unnecessary real-world injury to people with colorable legal claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Court ignores these critical limits on its equitable discretion today.  The Government seeks to enforce a questionably legal new policy immediately, but it offers no evidence that it will suffer any harm if it is temporarily enjoined from doing so, while the plaintiffs will be subject to imminent, concrete injury if the policy goes into effect.  The Court nonetheless fails to spill any ink considering the plaintiffs, opting instead to intervene in the Government’s favor without equitable justification, and in a manner that permits harm to be inflicted on the most vulnerable party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Such senseless sidestepping of the obvious equitable outcome has become an unfortunate pattern.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  So, too, has my own refusal to look the other way when basic principles are selectively discarded.  This Court has once again paved the way for the immediate infliction of injury without adequate (or, really, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;) justification.  Because I cannot acquiesce to this pointless but painful perversion of our equitable discretion, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For the past 33 years, across six Presidential administrations, transgender Americans have been able to obtain U. S. passports with sex markers that match their gender identity.  From 1992 to 2010, passport applicants who wished to obtain passports with sex markers that were different from the sex assigned to them at birth had to submit evidence of surgical reassignment.  In 2010, the State Department began allowing passport applicants to submit a doctor’s certification avowing that they had undergone clinical treatment for gender transition.  Beginning in 2021, the State Department allowed applicants to self-select the sex marker that matched their gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Through it all, the indisputable point of a passport remained: to “attes[t] to the identity and nationality of the bearer.”  &lt;a href="/cfr/text/22"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt; CFR §51.1 (2024).  The State Department’s sex-marker policies have thus long demonstrated that what is important for identification purposes is the bearer’s gender identity &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; No matter.  On January 22, 2025, the agency overhauled the rules for sex markers on passports, reverting to its pre-1992 practices.  Its Passport Policy now requires that all new passports reflect the holders’ sex &lt;em&gt;assigned at birth&lt;/em&gt;.  Why?  Because two days earlier, on January 20, President Trump issued &lt;a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/cpd/executiveorder/14168"&gt;Executive Order No. 14168&lt;/a&gt;, characterizing transgender identity as “false” and “corrosive” to American society.  &lt;a href="/rio/citation/90_FR_8615"&gt;90 Fed. Reg. 8615&lt;/a&gt; (2025).  The order asserted that “the policy of the United States” is “to recognize two sexes, male and female,” which it defined based on the sex assigned “at conception.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.  &lt;/em&gt;And the order directed the Secretary of State to require that any new government-issued identification documents reflect the holder’s “biological” sex.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 8615–8616.  The State Department responded by rescinding its prior sex-identification policies moving forward; transgender Americans who had previously obtained passports with sex markers reflecting their gender identity rather than their sex assigned at birth could continue to use those documents until they expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Several transgender Americans who want or need to obtain new passports filed a putative class action in the District of Massachusetts, challenging the State Department’s decision to upend 33 years of settled practice.  They claimed that the Passport Policy violated the Equal Protection Clause twice over: It unlawfully discriminated on the basis of sex, and it lacked any rational basis because it was motivated by bare animus against transgender Americans.  In addition, they claimed that the Passport Policy violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) insofar as it was arbitrary and capricious and was enacted without observance of the procedures that another statute—the Paperwork Reduction Act—requires.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The District Court thoroughly examined the facts in evidence, considered applicable law, and issued a 56-page decision.  It also issued an order preliminarily enjoining the Government from enforcing the Passport Policy against the plaintiffs.  The court made a reasoned determination that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their legal claims, that they would suffer concrete and irreparable injuries without an injunction, and that, by contrast, the Government would experience no harm from an injunction temporarily preventing it from enforcing the new policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Government appealed this order, and its appeal remains pending before the First Circuit.  Two months later, the District Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and extended the preliminary injunction to a subset of the certified classes.  The Government unsuccessfully sought a stay of the District Court’s orders (from both the District Court and the First Circuit) pending appeal.  So, the Government has now turned to this Court for a stay—and, for the first time, it has found an obliging audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; First principles of equitable relief illuminate the extent, and nature, of the Court’s error in granting this stay.  Stated succinctly, the indisputable touchstone of equity is fairness.  See Black’s Law Dictionary 679 (12th ed. 2024) (defining “equity” as “[t]he body of principles constituting what is fair and right”).  Courts proceeding in equity “loo[k] for justice on both sides of the suit and beyond.”  P. Hoffer, The Law’s Conscience 14 (1990).  To do so, we consider, in addition to the merits, whether the movant will be irreparably harmed absent relief.  &lt;em&gt;Amoco Production Co. &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Gambell&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/480/531"&gt;480 U. S. 531&lt;/a&gt;, 542 (1987).  And we balance the harms that each party might face with and without court intervention.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Where intervention is appropriate, the remedy must be tailored to “the peculiar rights of all the parties in interest.”  1 J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence §28, p. 21 (13th ed. 1886).  Indeed, the Court makes equitable determinations in light of “the necessities of the particular case.”  &lt;em&gt;Hecht Co. &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Bowles&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/321/321"&gt;321 U. S. 321&lt;/a&gt;, 329 (1944).  Courts exercising equity jurisdiction are not “mechanically obligated” to award relief “for every violation of law.”  &lt;em&gt;Weinberger&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Romero-Barcelo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/456/305"&gt;456 U. S. 305&lt;/a&gt;, 313 (1982).  Nor will courts sitting in equity grant relief if doing so would burden one party and be “of little advantage” to the other.  &lt;em&gt;Di Giovanni&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Camden Fire Ins. Assn.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/296/64"&gt;296 U. S. 64&lt;/a&gt;, 71 (1935).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; These key principles are necessarily applicable to preliminary injunctions and other interim orders, which are forms of equitable relief.  See &lt;em&gt;Winter&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/555/7"&gt;555 U. S. 7&lt;/a&gt;, 32 (2008) (“An injunction is a matter of equitable discretion”); &lt;em&gt;Trump&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;International Refugee Assistance Project&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/582/571"&gt;582 U. S. 571&lt;/a&gt;, 580 (2017) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;) (“In assessing the lower courts’ exercise of equitable discretion, we bring to bear an equitable judgment of our own”).  Just last Term, we emphasized, for example, that “[t]he purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held, and to balance the equities as the litigation moves forward.”  &lt;em&gt;Lackey&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Stinnie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/604/192"&gt;604 U. S. 192&lt;/a&gt;, 200 (2025) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  A stay decision, made “before the legality” of the challenged government action “has been conclusively determined,” presents a similar question.  &lt;em&gt;Nken&lt;/em&gt;, 556 U. S., at 434.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  With these kinds of interim decisions, courts must, among other things, “balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.”  &lt;em&gt;Amoco Production Co.&lt;/em&gt;, 480 U. S., at 542.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Fortunately, here, the lower courts have already done this critical work.  Based on its evaluation of the evidence related to the Passport Policy, the District Court reasonably determined that the plaintiffs were likely to suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief, and that the balance of the equities favored the plaintiffs.  See 778 F. Supp. 3d 394, 426–429 (Mass. 2025).  The First Circuit agreed and declined to stay the District Court’s preliminary injunction.  &lt;em&gt;Agatha &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Trump, &lt;/em&gt;151 F. 4th 9, 12–13 (2025).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; At a minimum, then, the Government bears an “especially heavy burden” to obtain a stay from &lt;em&gt;this &lt;/em&gt;Court.  &lt;em&gt;Edwards&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hope Medical Group for Women&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/512/1301"&gt;512 U. S. 1301&lt;/a&gt;, 1302 (1994) (Scalia, J., in chambers) (internal quotation marks omitted).  It can satisfy that burden only if it demonstrates that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its legal claims, that it will suffer irreparable harm from the preliminary injunction, and that the harm it experiences from not being able to implement its new policy outweighs the harm that its new policy will cause the plaintiffs.  See &lt;em&gt;International Refugee Assistance Project&lt;/em&gt;, 582 U. S., at 580.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As stay applications go, for the reasons explained in Part III–A, &lt;em&gt;infra&lt;/em&gt;, this case is easy—the Government has come nowhere close to meeting this demanding standard, especially because it has failed to demonstrate &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; harm from the District Court’s injunction, let alone harm that surpasses the injury to the plaintiffs if the Passport Policy were to go into effect.  But the Court somehow sees fit to grant the Government’s stay request regardless, waving away its abject failure to show any irreparable harm and promoting a patently inequitable outcome to boot.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;III&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: justify; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Government maintains that immediate implementation of the Passport Policy is necessary to ensure that sex markers on passports accurately identify the holders.  According to the Government, self-selected gender identity “does not provide a meaningful basis for identification,” while sex assigned at birth apparently does.  &lt;a href="/rio/citation/90_FR_8616"&gt;90 Fed. Reg. 8616&lt;/a&gt;.  The Government also contends that the Passport Policy is part of the President’s effort to impose a uniform definition of sex throughout the Federal Government.  The preliminary injunction, the Government says, impedes the President from carrying out these supposedly legitimate objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Thus, the Government’s asserted harm from being subjected to the injunction—its &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; asserted harm—is that the President cannot, at least for now, enact his preferred policies regarding sex markers on U. S. passports.  Even assuming, &lt;em&gt;arguendo&lt;/em&gt;, that this purported injury counts as irreparable harm, it does not suffice to justify the extraordinary equitable remedy of a stay pending appeal.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; What the Government needs (and what it does not have) is an explanation for why it faces harm unless the President’s chosen policy is implemented &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.  It suggests that there is an urgent foreign policy interest in dictating sex markers on passports, but does not elaborate as to what that interest might possibly be.  All the Government is able to muster is the statement that “the injunction forces the government to misrepresent the sex of passport holders to foreign nations” and to “contradict . . . biological reality.”  Application for Stay of Injunction 34.  But how urgent can this interest be when the Passport Policy itself allows transgender Americans who already have passports with sex markers reflecting their current gender identity to continue using those passports until they expire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Government also insists that gender identity is not a meaningful basis for identification—strangely begging the question why sex markers are required on passports at all.  And, in any event, it provides no evidence of harmful confusion or other problems caused by transgender Americans who are using passports with sex markers corresponding to their current gender identity.  To the contrary, as the plaintiffs’ experiences demonstrate, it is gender-&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;congruent passports that cause confusion and fail to provide a meaningful basis for identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As for the Government’s suggestion that the President is harmed by not being able to impose a uniform definition of sex across various regulatory schemes, that assertion is just another species of the far-fetched contention that the President must be injured whenever he is prevented from doing as he wishes.  &lt;em&gt;Department of Homeland Security &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; D. V. D.&lt;/em&gt;, 606 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2025) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt;, J., dissenting from grant of stay) (slip op., at 11–12).  The Government also fails to explain why it needs a uniform definition of sex, much less why such a uniform definition needs to be imposed &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; such that it cannot await the outcome of this litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; At the end of the day, then, despite its heavy burden to support its bid for a stay, the Government has not identified or articulated any way in which it will &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; be harmed if it cannot enact its new Passport Policy while the parties litigate whether that policy is lawful.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For their part (and by contrast), the plaintiffs have shown they will suffer concrete injuries if the Government’s Passport Policy is immediately enforced; namely, they will be unable to obtain passports with sex markers that match their gender identity.  The District Court found that this is a significant harm, noting that transgender people who encounter obstacles to obtaining gender-congruent identity documents are almost twice as likely to experience suicidal ideation, and report more severe psychological distress, than transgender people who do not face such barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In addition, the current record demonstrates that transgender people who use gender-incongruent passports are exposed to increased violence, harassment, and discrimination.  For example, one of the plaintiffs, AC Goldberg, who is a transgender and intersex person, asserts that he has been sexually assaulted by Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers conducting searches on his body.  Another plaintiff, Chastain Anderson, attests to having been strip searched when traveling with identity documents that do not match her current gender expression.  Another, Zaya Perysian, has been subjected to invasive patdowns by TSA agents to confirm her gender after they observed the disjunction between her female gender expression and the male sex marker on her passport.  And two others, Ashton Orr and Ray Gorlin, have been accused of presenting fake identity documents, and were forced to out themselves as transgender and nonbinary to TSA agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Airport checkpoints are stressful and invasive for travelers under typical circumstances—even without the added friction of being forced to present government-issued identification documents that do not reflect one’s identity.  Thus, by preventing transgender Americans from obtaining gender-congruent passports, the Government is doing more than just making a statement about its belief that transgender identity is “false.”  The Passport Policy also invites&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the probing, and at times humiliating, additional scrutiny these plaintiffs have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Given this, it is no surprise that each of the plaintiffs credibly testified that they would experience significant anxiety and fear for their safety if required to use passports that reflect their sex assigned at birth rather than their gender identity.  Absent an injunction, the plaintiffs and the classes of transgender Americans they represent are forced to make a difficult choice that no other Americans face: use gender-incongruent passports and risk harassment and bodily invasions, on the one hand, or avoid all activities (travel, opening a bank account, renting a car, starting a new job) that may require a passport, on the other.  The harm to these individuals from having to make that choice—before their legal challenges have even been resolved—is palpable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The documented real-world harms to these plaintiffs obviously outweigh the Government’s unexplained (and inexplicable) interest in immediate implementation of the Passport Policy.  That incongruity is where equity comes in.  Because granting the stay application will be “of little advantage” to the Government, &lt;em&gt;Di Giovanni&lt;/em&gt;, 296 U. S., at 71, while needlessly and significantly burdening the plaintiffs, equity cannot justify the Court’s intervention.  But, today, the Court refuses to answer equity’s call.  In my view, the Court’s failure to acknowledge the basic norms of equity jurisdiction is more than merely regrettable.  It is an abdication of the Court’s duty to ensure that equitable standards apply equally to all litigants—to transgender people and the Government alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-2ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  The Paperwork Reduction Act requires federal agencies to provide 60-day notice in the Federal Register before changing government forms that collect information.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/3506#c_2_A"&gt;44 U. S. C. §3506(c)(2)(A)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  Equity is at the heart of preliminary-injunction and stay determinations because these decisions require courts to decide disputes about the parties’ interim status while litigation over the merits of the challengers’ legal claims&lt;em&gt; is ongoing&lt;/em&gt;.  If the government is permitted to implement a harmful policy that turns out to be unlawful, the damage is done.  Courts generally endeavor to ensure that plaintiffs with colorable legal claims have a meaningful opportunity to litigate those claims and actually obtain the relief they are requesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-4ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;  Not only does the Court’s stay determination produce inequity, but it is also part of a broader pattern of this Court using its emergency docket to cavalierly pick the winners and losers in cases that are still pending in the lower courts.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 1 (order).  This way of handling stay determinations jeopardizes procedural fairness as well, because the lower courts have an obligation to fully and fairly consider the merits of the plaintiffs’ legal claims despite the majority’s declaration of the “likely” winner.  The Court’s stay-related pronouncements cannot be permitted to thwart the full legal process that our judicial system requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-5ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;  It is far from clear that this asserted injury qualifies as irreparable harm for stay purposes.  While we have suggested that the government suffers “a form of irreparable injury” when it is enjoined from effectuating a duly enacted statute, see &lt;em&gt;Maryland&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;King&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/567/1301"&gt;567 U. S. 1301&lt;/a&gt;, 1303 (2012) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Roberts&lt;/span&gt;, C. J., in chambers), an executive order lacks the force of a statute, and an injunction barring such an order does not generate the same sovereign injury.  To think it always does would be to endorse the “facially absurd” proposition that the President is irreparably harmed any time he is temporarily prevented from doing something he wants to do.  &lt;em&gt;D. V. D.&lt;/em&gt;, 606 U. S., at ___–___ (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt;, J., dissenting from grant of stay) (slip op., at 11–12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-6ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  The Government’s failure to show any harm from not being able to implement the Passport Policy immediately, much less a harm that outweighs the harm to the plaintiffs from the issuance of a stay, is sufficient to deny the stay application.  But to the extent we consider the merits, the majority’s confidence that the Government will probably succeed, &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 1 (order), is unfounded.  To the contrary, as the District Court and the First Circuit concluded, the Passport Policy is likely arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.  The State Department provided &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; explanation for its reversal of 33 years of practice.  And our precedent does not support the Court’s suggestion that an agency can expediently end-run the APA’s requirements simply because it is following the President’s orders.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  Even when an agency is bound by the decision of the Executive, it must still consider all relevant aspects of the problem before changing its policy.  See &lt;em&gt;Department of Homeland Security &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Regents of Univ. of Cal.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/1"&gt;591 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 29–32 (2020).  The plaintiffs have colorable equal-protection claims as well, particularly in light of the animus evident in the Executive Order.  See &lt;a href="/rio/citation/90_FR_8615"&gt;90 Fed. Reg. 8615&lt;/a&gt; (singling out transgender identity as “corrosive” to American society).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Dissent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;QUENTIN VENENO, J&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 24–5191. Decided November 10, 2025&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt;, with whom &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Thomas&lt;/span&gt; joins, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Petitioner asks us to grant review in this case to reconsider &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/118/375"&gt;118 U. S. 375 (1886)&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;Kagama &lt;/em&gt;helped usher into our case law the theory that the federal government enjoys “plenary power” over the internal affairs of Native American Tribes.  It is a theory that should make this Court blush.  Not only does that notion lack any foundation in the Constitution; its roots lie instead only in archaic prejudices.  This Court is responsible for &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt;, and this Court holds the power to correct it.  We should not shirk from the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As “sovereign and independent states,” Native American Tribes have governed their internal affairs “from time immemorial.”  &lt;em&gt;Worcester&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Georgia&lt;/em&gt;, 6 Pet. 515, 559–561 (1832) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Among the sovereign powers Tribes have always enjoyed is the power to redress crimes involving their own peoples.  Reflecting as much, a great many Tribes today have courts, not wholly unlike those found in States and counties across the country, open to render justice when one tribal member commits an offense against another on tribal land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In the Major Crimes Act of 1885, the federal government sought to curtail these traditional sovereign tribal powers.  There, Congress effectively wrote its own Indian criminal code, directing that tribal members who commit certain major crimes against other tribal members within “Indian  country” may be tried and punished in federal court.  &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt;, 118 U. S., at 377; see &lt;a href="/rio/citation/23_Stat._385"&gt;23 Stat. 385&lt;/a&gt;.  The Act may not have completely displaced tribal criminal-justice authorities.  See &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Wheeler&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/435/313"&gt;435 U. S. 313&lt;/a&gt;, 330–331 (1978).  Even so, the law surely represented a sweeping assertion of federal power, one that would be unthinkable elsewhere in the United States.  Yes, of course, Congress may adopt a variety of criminal laws consistent with its “limited” and “enumerated” powers under the Constitution.  &lt;em&gt;McCulloch &lt;/em&gt;v&lt;em&gt;. Maryland&lt;/em&gt;, 4 Wheat. 316, 406 (1819).  But, no, Congress does not enjoy some “general right to punish” crimes of its choosing “within . . . the States” however and whenever it pleases.  &lt;em&gt;Cohens&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Virginia&lt;/em&gt;, 6 Wheat. 264, 426 (1821).  Our Constitution “withhold[s] from Congress” that kind of “plenary police power.”  &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Lopez&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/514/549"&gt;514 U. S. 549&lt;/a&gt;, 566 (1995).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Despite these foundational principles, this Court in &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt; upheld the Major Crimes Act.  To arrive at that result, the Court relied on “little more than &lt;em&gt;ipse dixit&lt;/em&gt;.”  &lt;em&gt;Haaland&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Brackeen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/255"&gt;599 U. S. 255&lt;/a&gt;, 357 (2023) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas, J.&lt;/span&gt;, dissenting).  It had to.  Congress’s limited and enumerated powers no more include some plenary power over the internal affairs of Tribes than they do over the internal affairs of States.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 318–319 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch, J.&lt;/span&gt;, concurring).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt; itself all but admitted as much.  Before the Court, the federal government argued that the Act represented a permissible exercise of Congress’s power under the Constitution’s Indian Commerce Clause.  See Art. I, §8, cl. 3; Brief for United States in &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Kagama, &lt;/em&gt;O. T. 1885, No. 1246, p. 23.  But the Court rejected that argument, and rightly so, calling it “a very strained construction of th[e] clause.”  &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt;, 118 U. S., at 378.  In the Major Crimes Act, after all, the federal government asserted the power to regulate crimes between tribal members on tribal land “&lt;em&gt;without any reference&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;to their relation to any kind of commerce&lt;/em&gt;.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 378–379 (emphasis added).  And  while the Indian Commerce Clause may afford Congress considerable authority over “bilateral relations with the Tribes,” nothing in it authorizes Congress to “reassign to the federal government inherent sovereign authorities that belong to the Tribes.”  &lt;em&gt;Brackeen&lt;/em&gt;, 599 U. S., at 320, 325 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch, J.&lt;/span&gt;, concurring) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Having dismissed the government’s central defense of the Act, the Court was left to advance a hodgepodge of others with no more secure a constitutional footing.  First, the Court invoked the Territories Clause.  &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt;, 118 U. S., at 379–381.  But that provision affords Congress only the power to make “needful Rules and Regulations” for “Territor[ies] . . . belonging to the United States.”  Art. IV, §3, cl. 2.  And while the Clause may allow Congress to establish local governments in Territories belonging to the Nation before they enter the Union as States, it does not authorize Congress “to exercise municipal jurisdiction” over non-federal lands within a State and over which another sovereign exercises authority.  See &lt;em&gt;Lessee of Pollard&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hagan&lt;/em&gt;, 3 How. 212, 223–224 (1845).  Accordingly, that Clause can hardly supply authority for Congress to regulate conduct on tribal lands within States.  Nor, for that matter, does the Clause, rightly understood, endow the federal government with plenary power even within the Territories themselves.  &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Vaello Madero&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/159"&gt;596 U. S. 159&lt;/a&gt;, 184–185 (2022) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch, J.&lt;/span&gt;, concurring).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Next, and leaving the Constitution behind, the &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt; Court gestured to the European doctrine of discovery. 118 U. S., at 381–382.  But our Constitution makes no mention of that doctrine.  Nor, at least as conceived by the Marshall Court shortly after the Nation’s founding, does the doctrine imply plenary federal power over internal tribal affairs.  As that Court put it, even after the European “discovery” of North America, Tribes remained “distinct, independent political communities retaining their original natural rights,”  with only “the &lt;em&gt;single exception&lt;/em&gt;” that they could have no “intercourse with any other European potentate than the first discoverer.”  &lt;em&gt;Worcester&lt;/em&gt;, 6 Pet., at 546, 559 (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; From this, one might glean that the discovery doctrine meant one European nation could assert certain exclusive “rights” of intercourse with Tribes as “against all other European” claimants.  R. Clinton, The Proclamation of 1763: Colonial Prelude to Two Centuries of Federal-State Conflict Over the Management of Indian Affairs, 69 B. U. L. Rev. 329, 332, n. 6 (1989).  Perhaps, too, the doctrine meant that a private party could not buy tribal land without approval from the relevant European national authority.  &lt;em&gt;Johnson’s Lessee &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; McIntosh&lt;/em&gt;, 8 Wheat. 543, 604–605 (1823).  But even on its own terms, the Marshall Court appreciated, the discovery doctrine did nothing to strip Native American Tribes of “the rights which belong to self government.” &lt;em&gt;Worcester&lt;/em&gt;, 6 Pet., at 580; see also K. Richotte, The Worst Trickster Story Ever Told: Native America, the Supreme Court, and the U. S. Constitution 26–27 (2025); N. Newton, Federal Power Over Indians: Its Sources, Scope, and Limitations, 132 U. Pa. L. Rev. 195, 208–210 (1984).&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Lacking any other way to uphold the Act, the &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt; Court ultimately resorted to archaic colonial prejudices nowhere found in our republican Constitution and wholly antithetical to it.  The Major Crimes Act, the Court insisted, should be left to stand because “Indian tribes &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the wards  of the nation” and “communities &lt;em&gt;dependent&lt;/em&gt; on the United States . . . for their daily food.”  118 U. S., at 383–384 (emphasis in original).  Their “very weakness and helplessness,” the Court continued, imposed a “duty of protection” upon Congress that came with a corresponding “power.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 384.  As the Court saw it, “[t]he power of the General Government over these remnants of a race once powerful, now weak and diminished in numbers, [was] necessary to their protection.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For decades, what followed in &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt;’s wake was more of the same.  In one decision after another, this Court did not look to the Constitution for guidance on the scope of the federal government’s powers over tribal affairs.  Instead, and often citing &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt; as authority, the Court suggested that the government could exercise a free-floating “[p]lenary authority” over Tribes because they are “wea[k] and helples[s],” &lt;em&gt;Lone Wolf&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hitchcock&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/187/553"&gt;187 U. S. 553&lt;/a&gt;, 565, 567 (1903), and composed of “simple, uninformed and inferior people” who find themselves in the care of “a superior and civilized nation,” &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Sandoval&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/231/28"&gt;231 U. S. 28&lt;/a&gt;, 39, 46 (1913).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The plenary power theory &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt; helped spawn not only lacked any basis in the Constitution.  It also injected a new “incoherence into our Indian-law jurisprudence.”  &lt;em&gt;Brackeen&lt;/em&gt;, 599 U. S., at 329 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch, J.&lt;/span&gt;, concurring).  Since the founding and to this day, this Court has acknowledged that Congress enjoys only limited and enumerated powers and that Tribes are “sovereign and independent states.”  &lt;em&gt;Worcester&lt;/em&gt;, 6 Pet., at 561 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also &lt;em&gt;Wheeler&lt;/em&gt;, 435 U. S., at 331.  Yet, thanks to decisions like &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt;, this Court has also sometimes suggested that Congress enjoys plenary power to “regulate virtually every aspect of the tribes.”  &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Lara&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/541/193"&gt;541 U. S. 193&lt;/a&gt;, 214–215 (2004) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas, J.&lt;/span&gt;, concurring in judgment).  “Those two propositions of course clash”  because “only one is true.”  &lt;em&gt;Brackeen&lt;/em&gt;, 599 U. S., at 330 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch, J.&lt;/span&gt;, concurring).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Embarrassed equally by the lawlessness of decisions from the “high plenary power era” and the incoherence they introduced into our case law, this Court has, with time, beaten a slow retreat from them.  See S. Cleveland, Powers Inherent in Sovereignty: Indians, Aliens, Territories, and the Nineteenth Century Origins of Plenary Power over Foreign Affairs, 81 Texas L. Rev. 1, 62 (2002); see also &lt;em&gt;Brackeen&lt;/em&gt;, 599 U. S., at 326–330 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch, J.&lt;/span&gt;, concurring) (tracing these developments).  Just two years ago, that retreat found notable expression in &lt;em&gt;Brackeen&lt;/em&gt; where this Court once again recognized that the Constitution affords Congress only “a series of enumerated powers, not a series of blank checks,” and that, “like the rest of its legislative powers, Congress’s authority to regulate Indians must derive from the Constitution, not the atmosphere.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 273, 276 (majority opinion); see also &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 330 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch, J.&lt;/span&gt;, concurring).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; That is exactly right.  And it is exactly why this Court must confront decisions, like &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt;, that cannot be explained by the Constitution, but only by the atmosphere of their times.  I regret that the Court declines to take up that challenge today.  But whether the day of reckoning for the plenary power theory comes sooner or later, it must come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Nor is that day to be feared.  If this Court were to overturn &lt;em&gt;Kagama&lt;/em&gt;, Tribes could exercise their sovereign powers to address “major” crimes among Indians, something this Court has no business assuming they are too “inferior” or “weak” to do without supervision from a “superior” people.  Equally, if Tribes and the government decide that a degree of federal involvement in tribal justice is mutually beneficial, the Constitution affords a lawful way to achieve that end: by treaty.  Art. II, §2, cl. 2; see &lt;em&gt;Worcester&lt;/em&gt;, 6 Pet., at 550–551.  The government may be out of practice using that tool.  See Act of Mar. 3, 1871, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/16_Stat._566"&gt;16 Stat. 566&lt;/a&gt;.  But Congress  often addressed criminal justice matters in treaties with Tribes before the Major Crimes Act, and it could do so again.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;a href="/rio/citation/7_Stat._40"&gt;7 Stat. 40&lt;/a&gt;–41; &lt;a href="/rio/citation/15_Stat._635"&gt;15 Stat. 635&lt;/a&gt;–636.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Doubtless, as the government stresses in its opposition to this petition, many of this Court’s plenary power decisions have stood for years.  Brief in Opposition 22–24.  But the same was once said in defense of &lt;em&gt;Plessy&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Ferguson&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/163/537"&gt;163 U. S. 537 (1896)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Korematsu&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/214"&gt;323 U. S. 214 (1944)&lt;/a&gt;.  And, as with those cases, our plenary power decisions demand reconsideration if this Court is ever to bring coherence to the law and make good on its promise of fidelity to the Constitution.  A matter so grave “ ‘can[not] be settled until settled right.’ ”  F. Coudert, The Evolution of the Doctrine of Territorial Incorporation, 26 Colum. L. Rev. 823, 842 (1926) (quoting Justice John Marshall Harlan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-1ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; *Even as articulated by the Marshall Court, the discovery doctrine leaves much to be desired.  If “discovering” a land is enough to secure certain rights over it, one might wonder why Native Americans hadn’t obtained those rights over their lands long before Europeans arrived.  As one commentator had already asked by the time of the Nation’s founding:  “If sailing along a coast can give a right to a country, then might the people of Japan become, as soon as they please, the proprietors of Britain”?  R. Price, Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty, the Principles of Government, and the Justice and Policy of the War with America 23 (1776) (emphasis deleted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Dissent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;SUSAN HUTSON &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; UNITED STATES, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 24–1022. Decided November 17, 2025&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.  &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt; would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Alito&lt;/span&gt;, with whom &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Thomas&lt;/span&gt; joins, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I would have granted certiorari to terminate the longstanding and unlawful prison-building order at the center of this case.  In 2019, the District Court ordered New Orleans to construct a new facility for inmates with mental-health needs.  Yet the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) specifically states that “[n]othing in this section shall be construed to authorize the courts, in exercising their remedial powers, to order the construction of prisons.”  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3626#a_1_C"&gt;18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(C)&lt;/a&gt;.  If a court issued an injunction in violation of the PLRA, then a party “shall be entitled to the immediate termination of any prospective relief.”  §3626(b)(2); see &lt;em&gt;Miller &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;French&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/530/327"&gt;530 U. S. 327&lt;/a&gt;, 331 (2000).  Thus, because the prison-building injunction was illegal from the beginning, the courts below should have terminated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The lower courts further erred by failing to terminate the injunction for a second, independent reason.  Even if an injunction complied with the PLRA when it was issued, the injunction “shall be terminable . . . 2 years after the date the court granted or approved the prospective relief.”  §3626(b)(1)(A)(i).  Here, the New Orleans sheriff filed a “ ‘motion to terminate all orders regarding the construction of the Phase III jail’ ” four years after the court granted the injunction.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 81a.  At that point, the  District Court could maintain the injunction only if it found the injunction “remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation,” “extends no further than necessary,” and “is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.”  §3626(b)(3).  There is a Circuit split about which party bears the burden at this stage of the litigation.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;*  But Fifth Circuit precedent places the burden on the party supporting the injunction—not the party seeking termination.  &lt;em&gt;Guajardo&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Texas Dept. of Crim. Justice&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/363_F.3d_392"&gt;363 F. 3d 392&lt;/a&gt;, 395–396 (2004) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).  Here, the lower courts did not hold the Government or private plaintiffs to their burden.  Rather, the courts below denied the sheriff ’s termination motion because it provided no “basis for the district court to grant it.”  &lt;em&gt;Anderson &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Hutson, &lt;/em&gt;114 F. 4th 408, 420 (CA5 2024).  That gets the inquiry backwards.  It was not the sheriff ’s burden to provide a basis for termination; it was the opposing parties’ burden to show a basis for maintaining the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In short, the Fifth Circuit erroneously resolved an important issue of federal law on which there is a Circuit split.  This case cried out for our review.  By failing to intervene, we leave New Orleans to pay for the Fifth Circuit’s serious errors.  I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Per Curiam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;JEFFREY CLYDE PITTS &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; MISSISSIPPI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court of mississippi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 24–1159. Decided November 24, 2025&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Per Curiam&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Ordinarily, the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment"&gt;Sixth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;’s Confrontation Clause “guarantees the defendant a face-to-face meeting with witnesses appearing before the trier of fact.”  &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Iowa&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/487/1012"&gt;487 U. S. 1012&lt;/a&gt;, 1016 (1988).  In child-abuse cases, however, that rule sometimes gives way.  Consistent with the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment"&gt;Sixth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, a court may screen a child witness from the defendant when “necessary to protect [the child] from trauma that would be caused by testifying in the physical presence of the defendant, at least where such trauma would impair the child’s ability to communicate.”  &lt;em&gt;Maryland&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/497/836"&gt;497 U. S. 836&lt;/a&gt;, 857 (1990).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Still, before invoking this procedure, a court must proceed with care.  It must “hear evidence” and make a “case-specific” finding of “[t]he requisite . . . necessity.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 855.  Simply pointing to a state statute that authorizes screening, even one premised on “generalized finding[s]” of necessity, will not suffice.  &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt;, 487 U. S., at 1021.  Because the Mississippi Supreme Court departed from these principles, we reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In May 2020, A. G. C. spent a weekend visiting her father, Jeffrey Pitts.  After returning home, A. G. C. told her mother that she had been sexually abused.  Eventually, that report led to criminal charges against Pitts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; At trial, the State moved for permission to place a screen between A. G. C. and Pitts when she took the witness stand.  In support of its motion, the State pointed to a  Mississippi statute providing that child witnesses “shall have the . . . righ[t]” to “a properly constructed screen that would permit the judge and jury in the courtroom . . . to see the child but would obscure the child’s view of the defendant.”  Miss. Code Ann. §99–43–101(2)(g) (2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Pitts objected.  He did not question the statute’s mandatory terms.  But, he said, those terms had to give way to the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment"&gt;Sixth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;’s demands.  405 So. 3d 20, 31 (Miss. App. 2023).  And, he submitted, the State had not attempted to meet, and could not meet, its &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment"&gt;Sixth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; burden of showing that screening was necessary in the particular circumstances of his case.  405 So. 3d 1238, 1243 (Miss. 2025).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The trial judge granted the State’s motion.  In doing so, the judge reasoned that the “statute . . . appears to be mandatory,” and expressed “concerns about [his] ability to declare the statute unconstitutional and fail to follow it.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a (App.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; After a jury convicted him, Pitts appealed.  405 So. 3d, at 31.  Invoking &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt;, he argued that the trial court had failed to make the case-specific finding of necessity the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment"&gt;Sixth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; requires and, as remedy, sought a new trial.  405 So. 3d, at 31–35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Ultimately, a divided Mississippi Supreme Court rejected Pitts’s arguments.  The court did not dispute that the trial court failed to make a case-specific finding of necessity.  See 405 So. 3d, at 1246.  Instead, the court sought to distinguish &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt; on various grounds.  405 So. 3d, at 1248–1252.  With those distinctions in hand, the court then proceeded to hold that Mississippi’s mandatory statute provided sufficient authority for the screening in this case.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 1254–1255.  Unpersuaded, a dissent argued that &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt; controlled this case and that the trial court failed to comply with their terms.  405 So. 3d, at 1255 (King, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; After the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled, Pitts sought certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt; II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Under &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt;, a trial court may not deny a defendant his &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment"&gt;Sixth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; right to meet his accusers face to face simply because a state statute permits screening.  Nor may a court authorize screening based on “generalized finding[s]” of necessity underlying such a statute.  &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt;, 487 U. S., at 1021.  Instead, the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment"&gt;Sixth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; tolerates screening in child-abuse cases only if a court “hear[s] evidence” and issues a “case-specific” finding of “[t]he requisite . . . necessity.”  See &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt;, 497 U. S., at 855.  The Mississippi Supreme Court attempted to avoid these constraints by distinguishing &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt; in various ways.  But none of the court’s distinctions persuades.  Consider the most salient theories it pressed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; First, the court pointed to a victims’ rights provision in Mississippi’s State Constitution.  405 So. 3d, at 1246–1249.  That provision affords the state legislature the power “to enact . . . laws to . . . protect the rights guaranteed to victims.”  Art. 3, §26A(3).  And, the court observed, the state legislature exercised this power when it adopted the mandatory screening law the trial court applied in this case.  405 So. 3d, at 1249.  But, true as all that may be, it is also irrelevant.  When state law conflicts with the Federal Constitution, the latter controls.  Art. VI, cl. 2.  And under the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment"&gt;Sixth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, neither state screening statutes, nor the “generalized finding[s]” on which they are premised, are enough to overcome a defendant’s right to face-to-face confrontation.  &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt;, 487 U. S., at 1021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Second, the court stressed that Mississippi’s statute mandates screening in child-abuse cases while the Iowa statute in &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt; only afforded trial courts discretion to screen.  405 So. 3d, at 1249–1250.  But, if anything, the fact that Mississippi’s statute is mandatory—and thus &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; requires a case-specific finding of necessity—renders it “more  constitutionally problematic than the statute at issue in &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt;, not less so.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 1258 (King, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Third, the court emphasized that A. G. C. was four years old at the time of trial.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 1250 (majority opinion).  But &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt; involved a 6-year-old witness.  497 U. S., at 840.  And though a witness’s age is a relevant consideration, &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt; made plain that a court must “hear evidence” and make a “case-specific” “finding of necessity” before denying a defendant the right to face-to-face confrontation in a child-abuse case.  See &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 855.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Fourth, the court observed that in &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt; the government and the defendant disputed who committed the alleged assault, while in this case the identity of the alleged perpetrator was not in question.  405 So. 3d, at 1250.  But the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment"&gt;Sixth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; right to confront one’s accusers face to face does not only apply in cases where identity is at issue.  See &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt;, 497 U. S., at 840 (involving a known perpetrator).  Nor does &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt;’s exception for child-abuse cases automatically apply just because identity happens to be uncontested.  See &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 855–856.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Finally, the court noted that the child witness and lawyers in &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt; were placed in a different room from the defendant, with cross-examination conducted over closed-circuit television.  405 So. 3d, at 1251.  In this case, by contrast, everyone remained in the courtroom, the witness and defendant separated only by a screen.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 1244, 1251.  But both approaches deviate from the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment"&gt;Sixth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;’s usual rule that a defendant is entitled to meet his accusers “face to face.”  See &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt;, 487 U. S., at 1016; &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt;, 497 U. S., at 844.  And both thus require a case-specific finding of necessity.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 855.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Before this Court, the State does not so much defend the Mississippi Supreme Court’s various efforts to distinguish &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt; as press a different argument still.  As the State sees it, the trial court &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;“hear evidence” and make  a “case-specific” “finding of necessity.”  See &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt;, 497 U. S., at 855&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We disagree.  At trial, to be sure, the prosecution represented that A. G. C.’s guardian believed it would be difficult for her to testify face to face with her father.  App. 6a.  But the prosecution expressly rejected the notion that it had “to put on any proof,” choosing to rely instead on Mississippi’s mandatory “right” to screening.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 6a–7a.  And the trial judge proceeded to rule that the “statute . . . appears to be mandatory” and expressed concerns about “fail[ing] to follow it.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 36a.  Those arguments and conclusions fall well short of the procedures and findings &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Craig&lt;/em&gt; require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;III&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Having resolved that much, we pause to underscore what we leave unresolved.  Just because a constitutional error took place at trial does not necessarily mean a new one must be held.  Even constitutional errors are sometimes subject to a “harmless-error” rule and do not require a new trial if the prosecution can show “beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.”  &lt;em&gt;Chapman&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;California&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/386/18"&gt;386 U. S. 18&lt;/a&gt;, 23–24 (1967).  This Court has held that the denial of the right to face-to-face confrontation is among those errors “subject to that harmless-error analysis.”  &lt;em&gt;Coy&lt;/em&gt;, 487 U. S., at 1021.  Accordingly, on remand the State remains free to argue, and the Mississippi Supreme Court remains free to consider, whether the error in this case warrants a new trial under the harmless-error standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Mississippi Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;KARI BECK, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;personal representative of the&lt;/span&gt; ESTATE OF CAMERON GAYLE BECK,&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; et al.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt;  UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 24–1078. Decided November 24, 2025&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;.  Justice Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt; would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Statement of &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Sotomayor &lt;/span&gt;respecting the denial of certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As my colleague rightly explains, &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/340/135"&gt;340 U. S. 135 (1950)&lt;/a&gt;, is a difficult decision to justify.  See &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 3–5 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas, J., &lt;/span&gt;dissenting from denial of certiorari).  Since it&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was decided 75 years ago, &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;’s atextual expansion of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2671"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2671&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;et seq&lt;/em&gt;., has garnered near-universal criticism; has caused significant confusion; and has deprived servicemembers and their families of redress for serious harms they have suffered during service to this country.  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 3–5, 7–8&lt;em&gt;.  &lt;/em&gt;Like in this case, &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; has worked such harms even in circumstances far removed from the expected risks of military service.  It has, for example, barred recovery for claims arising from medical malpractice, sexual assault, and (as here) car accidents, even when those harms occur on U. S. soil, bear little relation to the military itself, and just as easily could have befallen any American civilian.  See &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;, 340 U. S., at 137; &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 7–8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Even so, out of respect for the Court’s rules of &lt;em&gt;stare decisis&lt;/em&gt;, and in recognition of the reliance interests that &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;has generated, I vote to deny this petition for a writ of certiorari.  Beyond the “special justification” that is needed to overrule any of our precedents, &lt;em&gt;stare decisis &lt;/em&gt;has “enhanced  force” on questions of statutory interpretation.  &lt;em&gt;Kimble&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Marvel Entertainment, LLC&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/446"&gt;576 U. S. 446&lt;/a&gt;, 456 (2015).  That is because, unlike with decisions of constitutional dimension, “Congress exercises primary authority” over statutory questions “and ‘remains free to alter what we have done.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Michigan&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Bay Mills Indian Community&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/572/782"&gt;572 U. S. 782&lt;/a&gt;, 799 (2014); see &lt;em&gt;Global-Tech Appliances, Inc.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;SEB S. A.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/563/754"&gt;563 U. S. 754&lt;/a&gt;, 765 (2011) (explaining the “ ‘ “special force” ’ . . . of &lt;em&gt;stare decisis &lt;/em&gt;with regard to questions of statutory interpretation”).  This “respect for Congress’s decision not to intervene promotes the separation of powers by requiring interested parties to resort to the legislative rather than the judicial process to achieve their policy goals.”  &lt;em&gt;Groff&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;DeJoy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/600/447"&gt;600 U. S. 447&lt;/a&gt;, 474–475 (2023) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Sotomayor, J., &lt;/span&gt;concurring).  Moreover, the “justification for statutory &lt;em&gt;stare decisis &lt;/em&gt;is especially strong” when Congress has considered but “spurned multiple opportunities to reverse” the Court’s interpretation of a statute.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 475.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; That is the case here.  Congress has often considered legislation that would overrule or limit the &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;doctrine.  See, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, H. R. 1517, 112th Cong., 1st Sess., §4 (2011); S. 1347, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., §2 (2009); H. R. 2684, 107th Cong., 1st Sess., §1 (2001); S. 347, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987).  Indeed, Congress most recently did so in 2019, see S. 1790, 116th Cong., 1st Sess., §729 (amendment as passed in the House), but ultimately decided to provide payments for certain service-related medical-malpractice claims under the Military Claims Act rather than the FTCA, see National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, §731, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/133_Stat._1457"&gt;133 Stat. 1457&lt;/a&gt;–1460, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/2733a"&gt;10 U. S. C. §2733a&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Congress, therefore, is “undoubtedly aware of ” the problems posed by &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;and “can change [&lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;] if it likes.”  &lt;em&gt;Allen &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Milligan&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/1"&gt;599 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 39 (2023).  “[U]ntil and unless it does, statutory &lt;em&gt;stare decisis &lt;/em&gt;counsels our staying the course.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.  &lt;/em&gt;I write, however, to underscore that this important issue deserves further congressional attention,  without which &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;will continue to produce deeply unfair results like the one in this case and the others discussed in &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Thomas’&lt;/span&gt;s&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;dissenting opinion.  See &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 7–8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Dissent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;KARI BECK, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;personal representative of the&lt;/span&gt; ESTATE OF CAMERON GAYLE BECK,&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; et al.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt;  UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 24–1078. Decided November 24, 2025&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Thomas&lt;/span&gt;, dissenting from denial of certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Air Force Staff Sergeant Cameron Beck was struck and killed by a civilian Government employee driving a Government vehicle.  His surviving wife sued the Government under the Federal Tort Claims Act, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2671"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2671&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;et seq&lt;/em&gt;., which waives the Government’s immunity for certain tort claims.  The lower courts dismissed her claim based on an expansive reading of the &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;doctrine, a “judicially created” FTCA exception for injuries incident to military service.  &lt;em&gt;Stencel Aero Engineering Corp. &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/431/666"&gt;431 U. S. 666&lt;/a&gt;, 674 (1977) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (citing &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/340/135"&gt;340 U. S. 135 (1950)&lt;/a&gt;).  I have long called for overruling &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;, which lacks any basis in the FTCA’s text.  But we did not need to overrule &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;to get this case right because Staff Sergeant Beck was not killed incident to military service at all.  He was killed in Missouri while off duty and going home to eat lunch with his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We should have granted certiorari.  Doing so would have provided clarity about &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;to lower courts that have long asked for it.  It would have resolved a Circuit split over whether, in applying &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;, courts should give special consideration to circumstances that implicate sensitive military affairs.  And it would have allowed Staff Sergeant Beck’s widow to recover for her husband’s wrongful death consistent with both the FTCA and our precedent.  I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt; I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; On April 15, 2021, Air Force Staff Sergeant Cameron Beck was off duty at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and riding his motorcycle home for lunch with his family.  A civilian federal employee driving a Government-issued van was distracted on her phone and turned in front of Beck.  They collided, and Beck died at the scene.  She was charged with criminal negligence.  The driver pleaded guilty and later said that the accident was “ ‘100 percent’ ” her fault.  Record in No. 4:23–cv–00255 (WD Mo.), ECF Doc. 23–1, p. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Kari Beck, for herself and her son, sued the driver’s employer for the wrongful death of her husband in what ordinarily would have been an open-and-shut wrongful-death case.  But in this case, the employer was the United States, which generally enjoys sovereign immunity from suit.  Eighty years ago, Congress recognized this problem and expressly waived sovereign immunity in cases like this.  The FTCA provides that the “United States shall be liable” for tort claims “in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,” including in cases where “death was caused.”  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2674"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2674&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Government moved to dismiss Mrs. Beck’s wrongful-death suit on the ground that the United States nonetheless was entitled to sovereign immunity.  The District Court granted the Government’s motion, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  125 F. 4th 887, 889 (2025).  The dismissal relied on this Court’s decision in &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;, which interpreted the FTCA to immunize the Government for injuries “incident to military service.”  340 U. S., at 144.  Mrs. Beck petitioned for review in this Court.  Today, the Court denies her petition, so Mrs. Beck will recover nothing in tort for her husband’s wrongful death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt; II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: justify; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The FTCA’s text does not compel the denial of relief to Mrs. Beck.  The FTCA makes the United States liable in tort “in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.”  §2674.  The FTCA includes a military exception, but it applies only to claims arising out of “combatant activities . . . during time of war.”  §2680(j).  It is inconceivable that driving home for lunch with one’s family while off duty can be characterized as a wartime combatant activity.  So, the exception does not apply in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Instead, the lower courts dismissed Mrs. Beck’s suit because of a broader exception that this Court created in &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;.  According to &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the FTCA’s waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply in any cases “where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to [military] service,” regardless of whether they arise out of wartime combatant activities.  340 U. S., at 146.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Feres &lt;/em&gt;did not base this doctrine on the text of the FTCA.  It acknowledged that the FTCA’s “exceptions might . . . imply inclusion of claims” involving servicemen, &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 138, because it excepts claims arising out of “combatant activities . . . during time of war,” but not peacetime, §2680(j).  It noted that earlier proposed versions of the FTCA almost invariably “expressly denied recovery to members of the armed forces; but the [FTCA] made no exception.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 139.  And it admitted that the FTCA “contemplate[s] that the Government will sometimes respond for negligence of military personnel,” &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 138, because it contemplates suits premised on the actions of “members of the military or naval forces” who “ac[t] in [the] line of duty,” §2671.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Government also recognized that the text posed a problem for its view.  Shortly before &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;, it “conceded” that the FTCA’s “language is sufficiently broad to cover” “claims arising out of the injury or death of members of the  armed forces . . . , and would &lt;em&gt;doubtless&lt;/em&gt; do so in the absence of ” extratextual considerations.  Brief for United States in &lt;em&gt;Brooks &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; United States&lt;/em&gt;, O. T. 1948, No. 388 etc., p. 10 (emphasis added).  And in &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; itself, the Government urged the Court to overlook the FTCA’s “broad language” and instead base its decision on “consequences.”  Brief for United States in &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Griggs&lt;/em&gt;, O. T. 1950, No. 31, p. 19; see &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;, 340 U. S., at 136–138.  In other words, if the enacted text controlled, there would be no &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;doctrine excepting injuries incident to service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Over time, the Court has offered shifting policy rationales for the &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; doctrine.  See &lt;em&gt;Carter&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, 604 U. S. ___, ___ (2025) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas, J.,&lt;/span&gt; dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 3–4).  In its last word on &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;more than 38 years ago, the Court settled on three.  See &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Johnson&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/481/681"&gt;481 U. S. 681&lt;/a&gt;, 688–691 (1987).  First, “[t]he relationship between the Government and members of its armed forces is distinctively federal in character.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 689 (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).  Second, the availability of “statutory disability and death benefits” counsels against tort relief.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  And third, suits falling within the exception “are the &lt;em&gt;type[s]&lt;/em&gt; of claims that, if generally permitted, would involve the judiciary in sensitive military affairs at the expense of military discipline and effectiveness.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 690 (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).  The Government took the position that this third rationale is “the primary basis for the &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; doctrine.”  Brief for United States in &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Johnson&lt;/em&gt;, O. T. 1986, No. 85–2039, p. 6 (Johnson Brief ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; doctrine has been “almost universally condemned by judges and scholars.”  &lt;em&gt;Carter&lt;/em&gt;, 604 U. S., at ___ (opinion of &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas, J.&lt;/span&gt;) (slip op., at 5).  Its three policy rationales do not make sense even on their own terms.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at ___ (slip op., at 5–8).  I have therefore long called for us to revisit &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;.  See &lt;em&gt;Clendening &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, 598 U. S.  ___ (2022) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas&lt;/span&gt;, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); &lt;em&gt;Doe &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, 593 U. S. ___ (2021) (same); &lt;em&gt;Daniel &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/1020"&gt;587 U. S. 1020 (2019)&lt;/a&gt; (same); &lt;em&gt;Lanus &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/570/932"&gt;570 U. S. 932 (2013)&lt;/a&gt; (same).  I continue to believe that we should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; But we did not have to overrule &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;to grant certiorari and reverse here.  Applying the doctrine’s existing limits, Staff Sergeant Beck’s death did not “arise out of . . . activit[ies] incident to” his military service, so &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;did not bar Mrs. Beck’s suit.  340 U. S., at 146.  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Staff Sergeant Beck was “killed during off-duty hours” and that his death “arose out of non-military activities.”  125 F. 4th, at 891.  &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;itself distinguished cases in which the injured serviceman was “under compulsion of no orders or duty” and was “on no military mission.”  340 U. S., at&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;146.  Beck was not ordered on a military mission to go home for lunch with his family.  So Mrs. Beck should have prevailed under &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; If &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;itself were not enough, the Court of Appeals’ conclusion also conflicts with another of this Court’s precedents.  In &lt;em&gt;Brooks &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/337/49"&gt;337 U. S. 49&lt;/a&gt;, 50 (1949), decided a year before &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;, an off-duty serviceman driving with his family was struck and killed by a civilian Government employee driving a Government truck.  This Court held that the suit could proceed under the FTCA.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;.,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at 51.  &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;did not overrule &lt;em&gt;Brooks&lt;/em&gt;.  On the contrary, they both asked whether the injury was “incident” to military service.  See &lt;em&gt;Brooks&lt;/em&gt;, 337 U. S., at 52; &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;, 340 U. S., at 146.  If the Court does not want to overrule its precedents in this area, it should at least be willing to enforce them.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_4-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt;’s policy rationales and this Court’s later &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; precedents&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;do not support immunizing the Government in this case either.  This case does not implicate “the primary basis for the &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; doctrine”: “bar[ring] suits that ‘would involve the judiciary in sensitive military affairs.’ ”  Johnson Brief 6.  This Court has said that &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; is “best explained by the peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors, the effects of the maintenance of such suits on discipline, and the extreme results that might obtain if suits . . . were allowed for . . . negligent acts committed in the course of military duty.”  &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Shearer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/473/52"&gt;473 U. S. 52&lt;/a&gt;, 57 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted).  For that reason, “[t]he rule enunciated in &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; allows suit in most cases having no likely effect on military discipline and effectiveness.”  Johnson Brief 20.  This is one such case: Mrs. Beck’s allegation that a civilian governmental employee accidentally crashed into her husband does not “cal[l] into question basic choices about the discipline, supervision, and control of a serviceman.”  &lt;em&gt;Shearer&lt;/em&gt;, 473 U. S., at 58.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Court of Appeals placed significant emphasis on facts that should not establish immunity.  It “pu[t] no special weight on whether resolution would involve the judiciary in sensitive military affairs” or scrutinize “military decision-making.” &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;125 F. 4th, at 891.  Instead, it emphasized that Staff Sergeant “Beck was injured on-Base, while on active duty, and subject to immediate recall.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  But this Court has explained that “the situs of the [injury] is not nearly as important as whether the suit requires the civilian court to second-guess military decisions, and whether the suit might impair essential military discipline.”  &lt;em&gt;Shearer&lt;/em&gt;, 473 U. S., at 57 (citation omitted).  And, on that point, the Court of Appeals did not deny that “resolution of this ordinary negligent-driving action would not require a court to  scrutinize or second guess military decision-making.”  125 F. 4th, at 891.  Further, the Court of Appeals emphasized that “Plaintiffs were entitled to military benefits.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  But this Court has long held that “[p]rovisions in other statutes for disability payments to servicemen, and gratuity payments to their survivors, indicate no purpose to forbid tort actions under the Tort Claims Act” when it is otherwise evident that the injuries were not “incident to . . . service.”  &lt;em&gt;Brooks&lt;/em&gt;, 337 U. S., at 52–53 (citation omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;C&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Lower courts are asking us for guidance on the &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;doctrine.  They “have reached the unhappy conclusion that the cases applying the &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; doctrine are irreconcilable.”  &lt;em&gt;Costo &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/248_F.3d_863"&gt;248 F. 3d 863&lt;/a&gt;, 867 (CA9 2001).  They have told us that the &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;doctrine is now “an extremely confused and confusing area of law.”  &lt;em&gt;Taber &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Maine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/67_F.3d_1029"&gt;67 F. 3d 1029&lt;/a&gt;, 1038 (CA2 1995); see also &lt;em&gt;Ortiz &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/786_F.3d_817"&gt;786 F. 3d 817&lt;/a&gt;, 822 (CA10 2015) (Tymkovich, J.) (“With all of this confusion and lack of uniform standards, it comes as no surprise that the &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; doctrine . . . has received steady disapproval from the Supreme Court on down”).  And they have called its outcomes “counter-intuitive,” &lt;em&gt;Richards &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/176_F.3d_652"&gt;176 F. 3d 652&lt;/a&gt;, 657 (CA3 1999), “unjust[,] and unwarranted,” &lt;em&gt;Cutshall &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/75_F.3d_426"&gt;75 F. 3d 426&lt;/a&gt;, 429 (CA8 1996).  As I have explained, it is unsurprising that, with its atextual roots and vague rationales, “[t]he &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; doctrine cannot be reduced to a few bright-line rules” and has thus left courts in disarray.  &lt;em&gt;Shearer&lt;/em&gt;, 473 U. S., at 57; see also &lt;em&gt;Carter&lt;/em&gt;, 604 U. S., at ___ (opinion of &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas&lt;/span&gt;, J.) (slip op., at 9) (collecting decisions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The confusion in the lower courts has created a “split on whether and how to take into account the three policy justifications . . . that this Court [has] articulated” for the &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;doctrine.  &lt;em&gt;Carter&lt;/em&gt;, 604 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11); see &lt;em&gt;Ortiz&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/786_F.3d_820"&gt;786 F. 3d, at 820&lt;/a&gt;–823.  The Fourth and Ninth  Circuits “focus primarily” on whether the suit “would call into question military discipline and decisionmaking.”  &lt;em&gt;Carter&lt;/em&gt;, 604 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (citing &lt;em&gt;Clendening&lt;/em&gt;, 19 F. 4th, at 427; &lt;em&gt;Ritchie &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/733_F.3d_871"&gt;733 F. 3d 871&lt;/a&gt;, 874–875 (CA9 2013); internal quotation marks omitted)).  By contrast, the Eighth Circuit in Mrs. Beck’s case put “no special weight on whether resolution would involve the judiciary in sensitive military affairs.”  125 F. 4th, at 891.  Other circuits, meanwhile, “do not consider ‘the presence or absence of the [three] &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; rationales’ &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;.”  &lt;em&gt;Carter&lt;/em&gt;, 604 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (alteration in original) (citing &lt;em&gt;Tootle &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;USDB Commandant&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/390_F.3d_1280"&gt;390 F. 3d 1280&lt;/a&gt;, 1282 (CA10 2004)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “These differing approaches have led to divergent outcomes in factually similar cases.”  604 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  The Circuits have split on whether “sexual assault by another soldier” falls within the &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;doctrine.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  (citing &lt;em&gt;Doe &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Hagenbeck&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/870_F.3d_36"&gt;870 F. 3d 36&lt;/a&gt;, 49–50 (CA2 2017) (yes); &lt;em&gt;Spletstoser &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Hyten&lt;/em&gt;, 44 F. 4th 938, 958–959 (CA9 2022) (no)).  They have split on whether “injuries arising during recreational activities with military-owned equipment” fall within the &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;doctrine.  604 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (citing &lt;em&gt;Costo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/248_F.3d_864"&gt;248 F. 3d, at 864&lt;/a&gt; (yes); &lt;em&gt;Regan &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Starcraft Marine, LLC&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/524_F.3d_627"&gt;524 F. 3d 627&lt;/a&gt;, 645–646 (CA5 2008) (no)).  And, after the Eighth Circuit’s application of &lt;em&gt;Feres &lt;/em&gt;here, they have split on whether a plaintiff who is injured in an off-duty, on-base car crash may sue.  See &lt;em&gt;Schoenfeld &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Quamme&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/492_F.3d_1016"&gt;492 F. 3d 1016&lt;/a&gt;, 1017–1018, 1023–1026 (CA9 2007) (yes); 125 F. 4th, at 890–891 (no).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For more than 38 years, this Court has given no clarity to a doctrine it created.  “The principal purpose of this Court’s exercise of its certiorari jurisdiction is to clarify the law.”  &lt;em&gt;Caperton &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;A. T. Massey Coal Co., &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/868"&gt;556 U. S. 868&lt;/a&gt;, 902 (2009) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  In other contexts, when lower courts report confusion and are in disarray, this Court grants certiorari to “resolve the circuits’ disagreement and  address our lower court colleagues’ calls for clarification.”  &lt;em&gt;Medina &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Planned Parenthood South Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/606/357"&gt;606 U. S. 357&lt;/a&gt;, 367 (2025).  We should have done so in this case.  I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_4-1ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; *Therefore, although I agree with &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Sotomayor &lt;/span&gt;that &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; “is a difficult decision to justify,” I respectfully disagree that “respect for the Court’s rules of &lt;em&gt;stare decisis&lt;/em&gt;” is a reason to deny the petition.  See &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;, at __ (statement of Sotomayor, J.).  The Court could have reversed here without overruling &lt;em&gt;Feres&lt;/em&gt; or any other decision of this Court.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Per Curiam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;TERENCE CLARK, DIRECTOR, PRINCE GEORGE’S COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; JEREMIAH ANTOINE SWEENEY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 25–52. Decided November 24, 2025&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Per Curiam&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; A Maryland jury found Jeremiah Sweeney guilty of  second-degree murder and several other crimes.  Sweeney’s convictions were affirmed on appeal, and his bid for postconviction relief in state court was unsuccessful.  Sweeney sought habeas relief in Federal District Court, and that court, too, denied relief.  But the Fourth Circuit reversed and ordered a new trial, relying on a claim that Sweeney never asserted.  Because the Court of Appeals departed dramatically from the principle of party presentation, we reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; According to the State’s witnesses at trial, Jeremiah Sweeney was arguing one night with neighbors about stolen marijuana.  He eventually opened fire, missing his intended targets but killing a bystander who was about 75 yards away.  At issue during trial was whether Sweeney could have been the shooter given his location and the angle of the bullet wound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; After the State rested its case, Juror 4’s curiosity got the best of him, and he decided to check out the crime scene for himself.  Shortly after jury deliberations began, Juror 4 told the jury about his visit, and the jury promptly reported his visit to the court.  The parties conferred and eventually agreed that rather than declare a mistrial, the court would dismiss Juror 4 and deliberations would proceed with 11 jurors.  Sweeney was convicted, and his convictions were affirmed on direct appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Sweeney later filed a petition for postconviction relief in state court.  He argued, among other things, that his trial counsel was ineffective under &lt;em&gt;Strickland&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Washington&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/466/668"&gt;466 U. S. 668&lt;/a&gt;, 686 (1984), for not seeking to &lt;em&gt;voir dire&lt;/em&gt; the entire jury to ensure that no other juror was tainted by Juror 4’s unauthorized crime-scene visit.  The state court denied relief after a hearing.  With the help of appointed counsel, Sweeney then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2254"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2254&lt;/a&gt; in Federal District Court.  As in state court, Sweeney argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for not seeking to &lt;em&gt;voir dire&lt;/em&gt; the entire jury.  The District Court denied Sweeney’s petition, concluding that the state court’s application of &lt;em&gt;Strickland&lt;/em&gt; was not objectively unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In an unpublished opinion, the Fourth Circuit reversed—but not on the ineffective-assistance claim that Sweeney brought.  Instead, the Fourth Circuit declared that Sweeney’s trial was marred by a “combination of extraordinary failures from juror to judge to attorney” that deprived Sweeney of his right to be confronted with the witnesses against him and his right to trial by an impartial jury.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a, 29a.  That error, the Court of Appeals concluded, entitled Sweeney to a new trial.  Judge Quattlebaum dissented, criticizing the majority for “flout[ing]” traditional principles of party presentation.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 99a–103a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “In our adversarial system of adjudication, we follow the principle of party presentation.”  &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Sineneng-Smith&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/590/371"&gt;590 U. S. 371&lt;/a&gt;, 375 (2020).  The parties “ ‘frame the issues for decision,’ ” while the court serves as “ ‘neutral arbiter of matters the parties present.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt; (quoting &lt;em&gt;Greenlaw&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/554/237"&gt;554 U. S. 237&lt;/a&gt;, 243 (2008)).  To put it plainly, courts “call balls and strikes”; they don’t get a turn at bat.  &lt;em&gt;Lomax&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Ortiz-Marquez&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/590/595"&gt;590 U. S. 595&lt;/a&gt;, 599 (2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Fourth Circuit transgressed the party-presentation principle by granting relief on a claim that Sweeney never asserted and that the State never had the chance to address.  Sweeney asserted “one, and only one,” claim in his federal habeas petition: that his counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate whether other jurors had been prejudiced by Juror 4’s crime-scene visit.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a (Quattlebaum, J., dissenting).  Instead of ruling on that claim, the Fourth Circuit devised a new one, based on a “combination of extraordinary failures from juror to judge to attorney.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 22a.  The Fourth Circuit’s “radical transformation” of Sweeney’s simple ineffective-assistance claim “departed so drastically from the principle of party presentation as to constitute an abuse of discretion.”  &lt;em&gt;Sineneng-Smith&lt;/em&gt;, 590 U. S., at 380, 375.  We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Fourth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; On remand, the Fourth Circuit should analyze the  ineffective-assistance claim that Sweeney asserted.  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, relief is barred unless the state court’s decision was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.”  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2254#d"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2254(d)&lt;/a&gt;.  When assessing a &lt;em&gt;Strickland&lt;/em&gt; claim that a state court has already adjudicated, the “analysis is ‘doubly deferential.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Dunn&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Reeves&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/731"&gt;594 U. S. 731&lt;/a&gt;, 739 (2021) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;) (quoting &lt;em&gt;Burt&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Titlow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/571/12"&gt;571 U. S. 12&lt;/a&gt;, 15 (2013)).  “[A] federal court may grant relief only if &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; ‘fairminded jurist’ would agree that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; reasonable lawyer would have made a different decision.”  594 U. S., at 739–740 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Harrington&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Richter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/86"&gt;562 U. S. 86&lt;/a&gt;, 101 (2011)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; With an eye on the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, several States have in recent months redrawn their congressional districts in ways that are predicted to favor the State’s dominant political party.  Texas adopted the first new map, then California responded with its own map for the stated purpose of counteracting what Texas had done.  North Carolina followed suit, and other States are also considering new maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Respondents in this case challenged the new Texas map, contending that the legislature’s motive was predominantly racial.  A divided three-judge District Court agreed and enjoined the use of the new map in the 2026 elections.  With the 2026 campaign underway, the State of Texas and several of its officials applied to this Court for a stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Based on our preliminary evaluation of this case, Texas satisfies the traditional criteria for interim relief.  See &lt;em&gt;Indiana State Police Pension Trust&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Chrysler LLC&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/960"&gt;556 U. S. 960 (2009)&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).  Texas is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim that the District Court committed at least two serious errors.  First, the District Court failed to honor the presumption of legislative good faith by construing ambiguous direct and circumstantial evidence against the legislature.  Contra, &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/1"&gt;602 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 10 (2024).  Second, the District Court failed to draw a dispositive or near- dispositive adverse inference against respondents even  though they did not produce a viable alternative map that met the State’s avowedly partisan goals.  Contra, &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 34–35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Texas has also made a strong showing of irreparable harm and that the equities and public interest favor it.  “This Court has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election.”  &lt;em&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Democratic National Committee&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/589/423"&gt;589 U. S. 423&lt;/a&gt;, 424 (2020) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).  The District Court violated that rule here.  The District Court improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The application for stay presented to &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Alito&lt;/span&gt; and by him referred to the Court is granted.  The November 18, 2025 order entered by the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, case No. 3:21–cv–259, is stayed pending the timely filing of an appeal in this Court.  Should a notice of appeal and jurisdictional statement be timely filed, this order shall remain in effect pending this Court’s action on the appeal.  If the appeal is dismissed, or the judgment is affirmed, this order will terminate automatically.  In the event that jurisdiction is noted or postponed, this order will remain in effect pending the sending down of the judgment of this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Alito&lt;/span&gt;, with whom &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Thomas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt; join, concurring in the grant of the application for stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I join the order issued by the Court.  Texas needs certainty on which map will govern the 2026 midterm elections, so I will not delay the Court’s order by writing a detailed response to each of the dissent’s arguments.  Instead, I offer two short points which for me are decisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; First, the dissent does not dispute—because it is indisputable—that the impetus for the adoption of the Texas  map (like the map subsequently adopted in California) was partisan advantage pure and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Second, the clear-error standard of review does not apply here because the “ ‘trial court base[d] its findings upon a mistaken impression of applicable legal principles.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/1"&gt;602 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 18 (2024).  Because of the correlation between race and partisan preference, litigants can easily use claims of racial gerrymandering for partisan ends.  &lt;em&gt;Cooper&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Harris&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/581/285"&gt;581 U. S. 285&lt;/a&gt;, 335 (2017) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Alito&lt;/span&gt;, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  To prevent this, our precedents place the burden on the challengers “to disentangle race and politics.”  &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt;, 602 U. S., at 6.  Thus, when the asserted reason for a map is political, it is critical for challengers to produce an alternative map that serves the State’s allegedly partisan aim just as well as the map the State adopted.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 34; &lt;em&gt;Easley&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Cromartie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/532/234"&gt;532 U. S. 234&lt;/a&gt;, 258 (2001).  Although respondents’ experts could have easily produced such a map if that were possible, they did not, giving rise to a strong inference that the State’s map was indeed based on partisanship, not race.  Neither the duration of the District Court’s hearing nor the length of its majority opinion provides an excuse for failing to apply the correct legal standards as set out clearly in our case law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Kagan&lt;/span&gt;, with whom &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt; join, dissenting from the grant of the application for stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Over the course of three months, a three-judge District Court in Texas undertook to resolve the factual dispute at issue in this application: In enacting an electoral map slanted toward Republicans, did Texas predominantly use race to draw its new district lines?  Or said otherwise, did Texas accomplish its partisan objectives by means of a racial gerrymander?  The District Court conducted a nine-day hearing, involving the testimony of nearly two dozen witnesses and the introduction of thousands of exhibits.  It sifted through the resulting factual record, spanning some 3,000 pages.  It assessed the credibility of each of the witnesses it had seen and heard in the courtroom.  And after considering all the evidence, it held that the answer was clear.  Texas largely divided its citizens along racial lines to create its new pro-Republican House map, in violation of the Constitution’s Fourteenth and &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxv"&gt;Fifteenth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;s.  The court issued a 160-page opinion recounting in detail its factual findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Yet this Court reverses that judgment based on its perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.  We are a higher court than the District Court, but we are not a better one when it comes to making such a fact-based decision.  That is why we are supposed to use a clear-error  standard of review—why we are supposed to uphold the District Court’s decision that race-based line-drawing occurred (even if we would have ruled differently) so long as it is plausible.  Without so much as a word about that standard, this Court today announces that Texas may run next year’s elections with a map the District Court found to have violated all our oft-repeated strictures about the use of race in districting.  Today’s order disrespects the work of a District Court that did everything one could ask to carry out its charge—that put aside every consideration except getting the issue before it right.  And today’s order disserves the millions of Texans whom the District Court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race.  Because this Court’s precedents and our Constitution demand better, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Recall the state of the world last spring, before mid- decade, overtly partisan redistricting (in both red and blue States) became &lt;em&gt;de rigueur&lt;/em&gt;.  In those months, President Trump and his political team urged Texas officials to redraw their House map, with the goal of creating more Republican seats and protecting that party’s vulnerable majority.  The project was on no one’s legislative agenda.  Texas officials had created a new map, per usual, in response to the population shifts revealed in the 2020 census.  And those officials expected that the State’s next map, again per usual, would follow the 2030 count.  A mid-decade redistricting, absent some legal need, was then nearly unheard of.  And although no one could challenge a partisan gerrymander in court—our decision in &lt;em&gt;Rucho&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Common Cause&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/684"&gt;588 U. S. 684 (2019)&lt;/a&gt;, saw to that—voters could hold those supporting it to political account.  (Again, this was in those innocent days—prior to Texas’s redistricting—when partisan gerrymanders seemed undemocratic or at least unsavory, rather than a mark of political conviction or  loyalty.)  For those reasons (and perhaps for fear of dummymandering too), the Trump Administration’s campaign for a new, partisan redistricting got little traction.  See App. to Application for Stay 2, 15–17.  On June 10, State Senator Joan Huffman—the sponsor of the 2021 map—testified in a judicial proceeding that the legislature was not considering redrawing its map.  See &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 17.  And on June 23, Governor Greg Abbott announced that he was calling a special legislative session to address various matters—but redistricting was conspicuously not among them.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; With so little to show for its efforts, the Trump Administration switched tacks—converting its political importuning into a legal demand.  On July 7, the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division sent the Texas Governor and Attorney General a letter—to serve, it said, “as formal notice”—describing the office’s “serious concerns regarding the legality of four of Texas’s congressional districts.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 17.  The letter focused on those districts’ racial composition.  Each was described as a “coalition district”—meaning a district in which two or more minority groups (say, Blacks and Hispanics) can &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; form a majority and elect a candidate of their choice.  (In racially diverse places like Texas, such districts are not uncommon.)  The letter stated—quite incorrectly (no one now tries to defend the proposition)—that the creation of those districts was unlawful: “It is well-established that so-called ‘coalition districts’ run afoul [of] the Voting Rights Act and the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv"&gt;Fourteenth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 18.  Accordingly, the letter maintained, they “must now be corrected”—“rectified immediately by [the] state legislature[ ].”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  The letter concluded that Texas should bring its current districting scheme “into compliance” with the (supposed) law, or else risk the U. S. Attorney General “seek[ing] legal action against the State.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; With that letter, Texas’s attitude changed.  Once the Administration’s redistricting proposal came packaged as a legal ultimatum to change various districts’ racial  composition, Texas embraced it.  Two days after receiving DOJ’s letter, the until-then-reluctant Governor Abbott issued a proclamation adding the following to the agenda for the upcoming special legislative session: “Legislation that provides a revised congressional redistricting plan in light of constitutional concerns raised by the U. S. Department of Justice.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 30–31.  And in late August, the legislature enacted a new map—one that &lt;em&gt;both &lt;/em&gt;secured five more  Republican-leaning seats &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;“achieved all but one of the racial objectives that DOJ demanded.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 3.  The map “dismantled and left unrecognizable” the districts that DOJ’s letter had identified, along with several similar coalition districts.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  And it made three of those districts into majority-Black or majority-Hispanic districts by the smallest amount possible, with the majority in each coming in at between 50.2 and 50.5 percent.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 97.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The plaintiffs here challenged Texas’s new map as a racial gerrymander, in violation of the Fourteenth and &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxv"&gt;Fifteenth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;s.  They did not contest that politics motivated the Trump Administration’s redistricting scheme, or that politics made Republican state legislators glad to vote for the map eventually developed.  But it was race, the plaintiffs argued, that gave the redistricting plan life—by enabling state officials to present it as a legal necessity rather than a partisan gambit.  And most important, they contended, it was race that mainly accounted for where the new, Republican-friendly lines were drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The law respecting a racial-gerrymander claim is well settled.  The Constitution forbids a State, absent a compelling justification, from “separat[ing] its citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race.”  &lt;em&gt;Bethune-Hill&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Virginia State Bd. of Elections&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/580/178"&gt;580 U. S. 178&lt;/a&gt;, 187 (2017).  To prove such racial sorting, the plaintiffs must show that race was the “predominant factor motivating the  legislature’s decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.”  &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/1"&gt;602 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 7 (2024).  They can do so through “ ‘direct evidence’ of legislative intent, ‘circumstantial evidence of a district’s shape and demographics,’ or a mix of both.”  &lt;em&gt;Cooper&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Harris&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/581/285"&gt;581 U. S. 285&lt;/a&gt;, 291 (2017) (quoting &lt;em&gt;Miller&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Johnson&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/515/900"&gt;515 U. S. 900&lt;/a&gt;, 916 (1995)).  And notably here, nothing changes just because the legislature has drawn race-based lines “in order to advance [non-race-based] goals, including political ones.”  &lt;em&gt;Cooper&lt;/em&gt;, 581 U. S., at 291, n. 1.  So it is unconstitutional (sans a compelling interest) for “legislators [to] use race as their predominant districting criterion with the end goal of advancing their partisan interests.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 308, n. 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Texas’s only defense to the racial-gerrymander claim here is that no such gerrymander happened.  In other words, Texas does not assert a compelling interest in drawing lines based on race.  Texas has never argued in this litigation that the DOJ letter was right—that it had to redistrict according to race in order to correct an existing legal violation.  And Texas of course does not contend that the pursuit of partisan advancement is itself a compelling interest.  (It is not.)  All Texas has ever said in response to the plaintiffs’ suit is that race had nothing to do with its redistricting process.  According to the State, its officials acted only to protect Republican incumbents in the House and to pick up another five predictably Republican seats.  In particular, Texas says, racial data never entered into the line-drawing process, even though the mapmaker had that data available at the press of a key on his redistricting software.  Any striking racial features of the new map were mere happenstance, Texas contends—a coincidence born of the correlation between race and partisan preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The District Court’s task, then, was a singularly factual one: It had to choose between the plaintiffs’ “race predominated” account and the State’s “race never entered the  picture” story.  To do so, it held a nine-day hearing during which it heard from 23 witnesses, received into evidence thousands of exhibits, and watched many hours of video footage of legislators and Governor Abbott discussing the proposed map as it was under consideration.  After assessing the credibility of the witnesses and weighing all the competing evidence, the District Court decided that the merits were “clearcut” in favor of the plaintiffs.  App. 152.  True, the ultimate goal of Texas’s redistricting was to pick up Republican seats.  But “[s]ubstantial evidence” revealed that race predominated in the actual drawing of district lines.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 2.  So, the District Court concluded, in acting to advance partisan interests, “Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In support of that conclusion, the District Court described three kinds of direct evidence, cumulatively “strong,” that race had played a predominant role in redistricting.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 59.  First, “[w]hat triggered the redistricting process” was the “Administration reframing the request” to do partisan districting “in exclusively racial terms.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 62.  Here, the crucial fact was the DOJ letter.  That letter, to be sure, did not specify exactly how Texas should “rectify” and “correct[ ]” its supposedly illegal coalition districts.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 59.  But (the court explained) “there’s only one way to remedy a district whose only ‘objectionable’ characteristic is that no single racial group constitutes a 50% majority”: to “redraw [the district] so a single racial group constitutes a 50% majority.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  The DOJ letter thus “impos[ed] a 50% racial target for Texas to meet when redrawing” certain districts.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.  &lt;/em&gt;And it thereby “directed Texas to engage in racial gerrymandering.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Second, the District Court described how the Governor promptly “ask[ed] the Legislature to give DOJ the racial rebalancing it wanted—and for the reasons that DOJ cited.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 31.  Although he had resisted redistricting for months, it took the Governor just two days from receipt of  the DOJ letter to add to the legislative agenda a proposal for responding to the “constitutional concerns raised” about certain districts’ racial composition.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;; see &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;, at 3–4.  And the court noted that, from that point on, the Governor consistently expressed support for the new map in those same racial terms: as a means to convert coalition districts into majority-Hispanic or majority-Black districts.  See App. 31–34.  In one interview, for example, he stated that “we wanted to remove those coalition districts and draw them in ways that, in fact, turned out to provide more seats for Hispanics.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 32; see also &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 33, n. 115 (“[W]e want to make sure that we have maps that don’t impose coalition districts”; “we’re able to take the people who were in those coalition districts and make sure they are going to be in districts that really represent the[ir] voting preferences”).  And conversely, the District Court related, Governor Abbott consistently “rejected the idea that Texas was redistricting to fulfill President Trump’s demand for additional Republican districts.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 64.  The Governor maintained, for example, that the map drew Hispanic seats, not Republican ones: “It just coincides it’s going to be Hispanic Republicans elected to those seats” given that more Hispanics were “align[ing] with Republicans.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 32; see also &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 34, n. 117 (The “districts we are drawing, they would be Hispanic districts” that just so “happen to be Hispanic Republican districts”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; And third, the District Court found that legislators, including the redistricting bill’s primary sponsors, repeatedly spoke in the same way: They “suggest[ed] that they had intentionally manipulated the districts’ lines to create more majority-Hispanic and majority-Black districts.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 3.  The legislator who introduced the bill, for example, crowed: “[W]e created four out of five new seats” to have a “Hispanic majority.  I would say that’s great.  That doesn’t ensure that a political party wins them, but the Hispanic—four out of five Hispanic majority out of those new districts—that’s a  pretty strong message, and it’s good.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 73, n. 258; see also &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 75, n. 265 (another legislator boasting that “previously, Black voters in that district did not hold a majority, but under [the new plan], they actually do”); &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 76, n. 267 (yet another legislator noting that one district was “purposely altered to [be] a Black [Citizen Age Voting Population (CVAP)] majority district” and another was “purposely changed to increase its Hispanic CVAP”).  The District Court, in reviewing the legislative evidence, well understood that partisan motivations underlay the new plan.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 76.  But the bill’s backers, the court explained, “strategized that a map that eliminated coalition districts and increased the number of majority-Hispanic and majority-Black districts would be more ‘sellable’ than a nakedly partisan map.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  Such a map would allow legislators to “deny they were redistricting for purely partisan reasons” and to gain more public support for the endeavor, especially among Hispanic Texans.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  Circumstantial evidence, the court continued, confirmed what the direct evidence showed: that race predominated in the drawing of district lines.  The new plan “fulfilled” almost all the racial goals “that DOJ and the Governor desired”; indeed, the map dismantled even more coalition districts than the DOJ letter had identified.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 105; see &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 50.  And most strikingly, the court noted, the map’s conversion of three of those coalition districts into majority-Black or majority-Hispanic districts was accomplished by the barest of margins—half a percentage point or still less.  So, the District Court recounted, one district went from 25.6% to 50.3% Hispanic; another went from 38.8% to 50.5% Black; and yet a third went from 46.0% to 50.2% Black.  See &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 97.  The court found it “very unlikely” that a mapmaker relying only on race-neutral criteria and using only non-racial data would “have hit a barely 50% CVAP &lt;em&gt;three times&lt;/em&gt; by pure chance.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 98.  It was uncontested that racial data came preloaded into the mapmaker’s  redistricting software, so he could look at it anytime he wanted.  The mapmaker testified to the court that he had not done so.  See &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 91.  But the court, noting that the mapmaker was “well aware” of the DOJ letter—indeed, that he had been shown a draft by White House officials before it was sent—“question[ed] [his] veracity” and “discredit[ed]” his testimony.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 96, 98, 99.  It was, the court concluded, “far more plausible that [the mapmaker] had both racial and partisan data turned on while drawing the 2025 Map and that he used the former to achieve the racial targets that DOJ and the Governor had explicitly announced as he simultaneously used the latter to achieve his partisan goals.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; And that conclusion was confirmed by expert testimony.  One of the expert witnesses testified that she had “generated tens of thousands of congressional maps that follow traditional districting criteria and favor Republicans by various metrics”—in other words, that eschewed racial goals and racial data.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 127.  The result?  “[N]ot one of them had racial demographics that looked anything like those in the 2025 Map.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  The expert’s analysis thus supported what the raw numbers (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, those three 50% districts) showed: It was—once again—“highly unlikely” that a legislature drawing a map based on “partisan and other race-neutral considerations” would have arrived at the one Texas enacted.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 121.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Put all of that together—the direct and circumstantial evidence alike—and the District Court’s conclusion followed: The plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their racial-gerrymandering claim.  The desire for more Republican seats no doubt motivated the redistricting project: It was, as this Court has said, the officials’ “end goal.”  &lt;em&gt;Cooper&lt;/em&gt;, 581 U. S., at 308, n. 7.  But the district lines drawn resulted predominantly “from the intentional manipulation of the districts’ racial makeup.”  App. 127.  Race provided the excuse for the partisan effort.  And yet more critically, race provided the  key means of implementing it.  And that, the District Court held, is a violation of the Fourteenth and &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxv"&gt;Fifteenth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;III&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: justify; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This Court owes, though today has not given, “significant deference” to the District Court’s marshaling and weighing of so much evidence.  &lt;em&gt;Cooper&lt;/em&gt;, 581 U. S., at 293.  You would never guess it from the majority’s order, but under this Court’s precedents, a district court’s factfinding about electoral districting—“most notably, as to whether racial considerations predominated in drawing district lines”—is reversible “only for clear error.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;; see &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt;, 602 U. S., at 18 (describing that test as “demanding”).  Under that standard, “we may not reverse just because we would have decided the matter differently.”  &lt;em&gt;Cooper&lt;/em&gt;, 581 U. S., at 293.  If a district court’s factual determination is “ ‘plausible’ in light of the full record—even if another is equally or more so”—that determination “must govern.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt; (quoting &lt;em&gt;Anderson&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Bessemer City&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/470/564"&gt;470 U. S. 564&lt;/a&gt;, 574 (1985)).  And in deciding what is thus “plausible,” we must “give singular deference to a trial court’s judgment about the credibility of witnesses.”  &lt;em&gt;Cooper&lt;/em&gt;, 581 U. S., at 309.  The district court has conducted the hearing and knows the whole record.  It is better positioned than this Court to decide what evidence to credit about the drawing of district lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Taking that standard seriously calls for denying Texas’s stay application.  In its 160-page opinion, the District Court marched methodically through the entirety of the trial record.  The court considered with care the evidence supporting Texas, as well as that supporting the plaintiffs.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., App. 79–104, 128–134.  The court explained each of the credibility judgments it rendered—noting, to take just one example, how one witness’s testimony conflicted with other evidence, including another witness’s testimony. See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 96–99 (discussing the mapmaker’s testimony).  Ultimately, the court weighed all the evidence and made findings, summarized above, about how Texas’s map was constructed.  I do not say that those findings were inescapable; a court coming out the opposite way could well have deserved this Court’s deference too.  What they were—and this is the thing that matters on clear-error review—is plausible.  It was “plausible”—perfectly plausible “in light of the full record”—that Texas drew its new map mainly on racial lines.  &lt;em&gt;Cooper&lt;/em&gt;, 581 U. S., at 293.  (Indeed, I think—though this is not necessary—that the court’s conclusion was right.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In asserting instead that the court’s conclusion was “implausible,” Texas argues that because it was trying to “maximize[ ] partisan advantage,” it would have relegated all racial considerations to the sidelines.  Application 11.  But that claim is too simple by half, as this Court has previously recognized.  Because of the “strong correlation[s] between race and voting behavior,” we have explained, States may well avail themselves of “race-based districting for ultimately political reasons”—that is, “to advance their partisan interests.”  &lt;em&gt;Cooper&lt;/em&gt;, 581 U. S., at 319, n. 15; see &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 291, n. 1.  So, for example, legislators may “think[ ] that a proposed district is more ‘sellable’ as a race-based VRA compliance measure than as a political gerrymander and will accomplish much the same thing.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 308, n. 7.  That is just what the District Court found that key Texas lawmakers thought in creating and supporting the redistricting plan.  See App. 3, 76; see &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;, at 8.  The District Court knew—explained repeatedly—that partisan motives lay beneath the new map.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., App. 2–3, 76–77.  But so too the court found that race was all over it.  The lawmakers created new Republican seats while—indeed, by means of—converting coalition districts into single-race majority- minority districts.  And once again, because that conclusion  is “plausible in light of the full record,” it “must govern.”  &lt;em&gt;Cooper&lt;/em&gt;, 581 U. S., at 293.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For its part, the majority complains—just as wrongly—that the District Court made a “serious error[ ]” in “fail[ing] to honor the presumption of legislative good faith.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 1.  That presumption is, to be sure, a well-settled part of our districting law.  Because of the complexity of electoral districting, we have explained, the State’s good faith must be presumed “until a claimant makes a showing” of “race-based decisionmaking.”  &lt;em&gt;Miller&lt;/em&gt;, 515 U. S., at 915.  But contra the majority, the District Court properly extended Texas that presumption.  It explained that federal courts “must exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating”  racial-gerrymandering claims.  App. 57 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt;, 602 U. S., at 7).  And it then stated what that caution entails in much the same terms as today’s majority uses: When considering evidence that could support either a racial or a non-racial account of a districting action, the court had to “draw the inference that cuts in the legislature’s favor.”  App. 58 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt;, 602 U. S., at 10); compare &lt;em&gt;ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 1 (calling for “ambiguous” evidence to be “constru[ed]” in the legislature’s favor).  In line with that understanding, the District Court found that certain legislators’ statements were too ambiguous to “clear the presumption of legislative good faith.”  App. 71–72, and n. 251 (again quoting &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt;, 602 U. S., at 10).  But other evidence, direct and circumstantial alike, was not; and as all the record evidence piled up, the court concluded that state officials “purposefully manipulated the districts’ racial numbers.”  App. 77.  Presumptions, after all, can be simultaneously “honor[ed]” and overcome.  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 1.  And so it was here, as the District Court assessed credibility and found facts—as, in the end, district courts must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The majority likewise is wrong to say that the District Court erred in “fail[ing] to draw a dispositive or near- dispositive adverse inference” against the plaintiffs for  their failure to “produce a viable alternative map” that met the State’s partisan goals without the enacted map’s racial features.  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 1–2 (citing &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt;, 602 U. S., at 34–35).  In fact, the District Court’s treatment of the “alternative map” issue fully accords with our instructions in &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt;—a case which, like this one, involved the “disentangl[ing]” of race and politics in redistricting.  602 U. S., at 6.  We first stated in &lt;em&gt;Alexander &lt;/em&gt;that the absence of a substitute map merits an adverse inference in a racial gerrymander case.  See &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 34–35.  And in line with that edict, the District Court drew one.  See App. 132.  We next said in &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt; that the inference thus drawn would be “dispositive” (&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;., fatal) only some of the time.  &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt;, 602 U. S., at 35.  When would it be so?  &lt;em&gt;Alexander &lt;/em&gt;answered: “The adverse inference may be dispositive in many, if not most, cases where the plaintiff lacks direct evidence.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  The District Court quoted that language, and explained why it did not force a dispositive inference here.  In short, because there was lots of direct evidence.  See App. 132.  Or as the District Court stated more fully: “Unlike the challengers in &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt;, who ‘provided no direct evidence of a racial gerrymander,’ the Plaintiff Groups here have produced substantial direct evidence indicating that race was the predominant driver in the 2025 redistricting process.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt; (quoting &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt;, 602 U. S., at 18).  So a racial gerrymander could be found, under &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt;’s own terms, despite the lack of a map.  That is because the map’s absence does not make the direct evidence of race-based decision-making go away.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_4-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  What, then, does the majority think is wrong?  One possibility lies in the word “near-dispositive” in today’s order. &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 1.  Perhaps the majority has a theory about why, despite all the direct evidence, a “near-dispositive” inference was still appropriate?  If so, that is made up for the occasion.  The word “near-dispositive” does not appear in &lt;em&gt;Alexander&lt;/em&gt;, which everyone agrees is the critical decision addressing alternative maps.  Nor does that term appear in any other of this Court’s decisions respecting adverse inferences (of any type).  (Actually, the word appears only three times in the whole U. S. Reports.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Rogers&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Tennessee&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/532/451"&gt;532 U. S. 451&lt;/a&gt;, 473, n. 2 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (referring to “[t]he near-dispositive strength Blackstone accorded &lt;em&gt;stare decisis” &lt;/em&gt;).)  So it is hardly surprising that the District Court did not address whether a “near-dispositive” inference was called for; and the court’s “fail[ure]” to do so can play no proper role in today’s order.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 1–2.  The remaining possibility—no more excusable for an appellate court—is that the majority is simply second-guessing the District Court’s factfinding.  That court, to repeat, rejected treating the adverse interest as dispositive (as &lt;em&gt;Alexander &lt;/em&gt;permits) because of the “substantial direct evidence” of race-based districting.  So maybe the majority is just saying that it sees no such evidence—that it interprets all the facts differently, as reflective of only partisan districting, with no racial component.  But on clear-error review, what basis does the majority have to thus substitute its understanding of the direct evidence for the District Court’s?  The short answer is: It has none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt; B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Nor does the majority have any warrant to stay the District Court’s order for “alter[ing] the election rules on the eve of an election.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 2.  Here, the majority invokes (though without naming) the so-called &lt;em&gt;Purcell &lt;/em&gt;principle.  See &lt;em&gt;Purcell&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Gonzalez&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/549/1"&gt;549 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 4–5 (2006) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).  Under that decision, courts deciding whether to enjoin an election rule or map in the lead-up to an election must consider, among other relevant equitable factors, the order’s potential for causing “voter confusion.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.  &lt;/em&gt;It is an important caution.  And it is one the District Court took seriously, considering how everything this Court has said on the subject applied to the facts at hand.  See App. 140–156.  In then going ahead, the court was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Texas is not on “the eve of an election,” as was true in the case the majority cites.  &lt;em&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Democratic National Committee&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/589/423"&gt;589 U. S. 423&lt;/a&gt;, 424 (2020) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;); see &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 2.  The election there was five days after the injunction.  Similarly, the election in &lt;em&gt;Purcell &lt;/em&gt;was “just weeks” away.  549 U. S., at 4.  Here, Election Day is eleven months from now.  Even the primary election (which Texas could change) is in March.  The District Court carefully listed the various “election preparations” underway to switch to the 2025 map.  App. 144.  On the other hand, the court noted how the 2021 map—which the injunction reinstated—was, in a real sense, the status quo.  See &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 145.  Officials, candidates, and voters are all familiar with it from the last two election cycles.  Until late last summer, everyone expected that map to govern 2026 too.  And indeed, it will be used in a special runoff election in the State’s largest county on January 31, 2026.  So, the District Court properly concluded, “[a]n injunction in this case would not cause significant disruption.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 144.  Except to the extent all of us live in election season all the time, the 2026 congressional election is not well underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  And even supposing it is now the ninth or tenth hour, whose choice was that?  It was of course the Texas legislature that decided to change its map six months before a March primary.  The plaintiffs could not have moved any faster: They requested an injunction before the new law was even signed.  And to try to speed the litigation, they declined discovery.  (That decision, by the way, probably accounted for their failure to submit an alternative map, which to be probative must be based on the State’s particular districting criteria.  See &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;, at 13 n.)  The District Court moved expeditiously too, issuing its 160-page opinion (on November 18) just a month after post-hearing briefing concluded.  No one dilly-dallied in this case.  The District Court ruled as “late” as it did because the legislature enacted a new map less than three months before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; If &lt;em&gt;Purcell &lt;/em&gt;prevents such a ruling, it gives every State the opportunity to hold an unlawful election.  The District Court, once again aptly, made the point: Were judicial review so broadly foreclosed, then to implement even a “blatantly unconstitutional map,” the “Legislature would need only to pass” it on a schedule like this one.  App. 154–155.  That cannot be the law—except of course that today it is.  According to the majority, Texas had a free pass to redistrict in August 2025 for the 2026 House elections.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 2.  All that the plaintiffs can hope for is better luck in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;IV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The majority today loses sight of its proper role.  It is supposed to review the District Court’s factfinding only for clear error.  But under that deferential standard, the District Court’s “plausible” (actually, quite careful) factfinding must survive.  The majority can reach the result it does—overturning the District Court’s finding of racial line- drawing, even if to achieve partisan goals—only by  arrogating to itself that court’s rightful function.  We know better, the majority declares today.  I cannot think of a reason why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; And this Court’s eagerness to playact a district court here has serious consequence.  The majority calls its “evaluation” of this case “preliminary.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 1.  The results, though, will be anything but.  This Court’s stay guarantees that Texas’s new map, with all its enhanced partisan advantage, will govern next year’s elections for the House of Representatives.  And this Court’s stay ensures that many Texas citizens, for no good reason, will be placed in electoral districts because of their race.  And that result, as this Court has pronounced year in and year out, is a violation of the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_4-1ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; *After explaining why the adverse inference was not dispositive in this case, the District Court also speculated that it might not have had to draw the inference at all because the case was at such an early stage.  App. 132.  (Here, the court noted that the expert testimony suggested that the plaintiffs would have had no trouble coming up with a map, so that their failure to do so likely reflected a lack of time.  See &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 134.)  This Court has not specifically opined on that matter one way or another.  But even assuming the adverse inference is appropriate at every stage of the litigation, the primary rationale of the District Court stands: The adverse inference was not dispositive because of all the direct evidence in the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;JOHN DOE &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; DYNAMIC PHYSICAL  THERAPY, LLC, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on petition for writ of certiorari to the court  of appeal of louisiana, first circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 25–180. Decided December 8, 2025&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Per Curiam&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Louisiana immunizes healthcare providers from civil liability during public health emergencies.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §29:771(B)(2)(c)(i) (West 2022).  Below, the Louisiana Court of Appeal held that this state statute barred plaintiff’s federal claims.  2024–0723, pp. 11–12 (1 Cir. 12/27/24), 404 So. 3d 1008, 1017–1018, writ denied, 2025–00105 (La. 4/29/25), 407 So. 3d 623.  That decision is incorrect.  Defining the scope of liability under state law is the State’s prerogative.  But a State has no power to confer immunity from &lt;em&gt;federal &lt;/em&gt;causes of action.  See,&lt;em&gt; e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Howlett&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Rose&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/496/356"&gt;496 U. S. 356&lt;/a&gt;, 383 (1990); &lt;em&gt;Haywood&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Drown&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/729"&gt;556 U. S. 729&lt;/a&gt;, 740 (2009); &lt;em&gt;Williams &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Reed&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/604/168"&gt;604 U. S. 168&lt;/a&gt;, 174 (2025).  “[T]he Judges in every State” are bound to follow federal law, “any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding.”  U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Plaintiff’s federal claims may well fail on other federal grounds.  Cf. &lt;em&gt;Cummings&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Premier Rehab Keller&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/212"&gt;596 U. S. 212&lt;/a&gt;, 222 (2022).  But that is for the Louisiana courts to decide in the first instance.  The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Louisiana Court of Appeal is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;ANTONIO NATHANIEL DAVENPORT, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Jr&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 24–7435. Decided December 8, 2025&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Statement of &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Sotomayor &lt;/span&gt;respecting the denial of certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I concur in the denial of certiorari because the petition is untimely and petitioner’s counsel gave no explanation for the delay.  See this Court’s Rule 13.1; &lt;em&gt;Schacht&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/398/58"&gt;398 U. S. 58&lt;/a&gt;, 64 (1970) (the deadline to file a petition in a criminal case may be “relaxed by the Court in the exercise of its discretion when the ends of justice so require”).  I write separately to address a statement made by the District Court when declining to give a jury instruction requested by petitioner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Petitioner was charged with, as relevant, murder in aid of racketeering.  See &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1959#a_1"&gt;18 U. S. C. §1959(a)(1)&lt;/a&gt;.  To make its case, the Government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner committed murder under North Carolina state law.  At trial, the proposed jury instructions at no point defined what it means to prove an element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  Petitioner asked the District Court to give a jury instruction defining reasonable doubt for the underlying murder charge drawn from a North Carolina template jury instruction: “‘For these elements of murder, proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that fully satisfies or entirely convinces you of the Defendant’s guilt of murder.’”  App. in No. 22–4660 (CA4), p. 1579 (CA4 App.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  The District Court demurred, stating that federal courts are “specifically prohibited from giving a definition of reasonable doubt.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 1493.  After further consideration, the District Court denied the request and explained that “the federal rule . . . prohibits a court from defining reasonable doubt over and above what’s included in the instructions already.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 1661.  As a result, the jury did not receive an instruction on what reasonable doubt means.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The District Court was mistaken.  Federal courts are not prohibited from defining reasonable doubt for the jury.  In &lt;em&gt;Victor&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Nebraska&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/511/1"&gt;511 U. S. 1 (1994)&lt;/a&gt;, this Court held that “the Constitution neither prohibits trial courts from defining reasonable doubt nor requires them to do so as a matter of course.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 5.  Almost all the Courts of Appeals abide by this understanding.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Walton&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/207_F.3d_694"&gt;207 F. 3d 694&lt;/a&gt;, 696–697 (CA4 2000) (en banc) (“[T]he well-established rule of this Circuit is that although the district court may define reasonable doubt to a jury upon request, the district court is not required to do so”); see also &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Alt&lt;/em&gt;, 58 F. 4th 910, 921, and n. 1 (CA7 2023) (Kirsch, J., concurring) (explaining that “all” circuits “but [the Seventh Circuit] give district judges at least some discretion to” define reasonable doubt).  Here, the District Court should have recognized that it had discretion over whether to grant petitioner’s request and define reasonable doubt for the jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; To be sure, in some cases, it may be wise not to define reasonable doubt.  See &lt;em&gt;Holland &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/348/121"&gt;348 U. S. 121&lt;/a&gt;, 140 (1954) (“‘Attempts to explain the term “reasonable doubt” do not usually result in making it any clearer to the minds of the jury’”).  In this case, for example, the District Court expressed concern that giving petitioner’s requested instruction as to the state-law murder charges, but no other aspects of the federal offense, might confuse the jury by suggesting they should apply different reasonable-doubt standards to different elements.  CA4 App., 1662–1663.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  Still, there are cases where defining reasonable doubt may be appropriate.  “While judges and lawyers are familiar with the reasonable doubt standard, the words ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ are not self-defining for jurors.”  &lt;em&gt;Victor&lt;/em&gt;, 511 U. S., at 26 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  “Several studies of juror behavior have concluded that ‘jurors are often confused about the meaning of reasonable doubt’ when that term is left undefined.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;. (quoting Note, Defining Reasonable Doubt, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1716, 1723 (1990)).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In view of the central importance of the reasonable-doubt standard to criminal procedure, balanced against the potential for confusion from a reasonable-doubt instruction, district courts should weigh the circumstances of each individual case to decide whether to provide a definition to the jury.  For example, a judge may choose to give an explanation to clear up potential confusion caused by a party’s misstatement of the standard.  Or a judge may give one if the jury asks for it.  This careful consideration will ensure that the reasonable-doubt standard retains its “indispensable” role in “command[ing] the respect and confidence of the community in applications of the criminal law.”  &lt;em&gt;In re Winship&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/397/358"&gt;397 U. S. 358&lt;/a&gt;, 364 (1970).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;_________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;No. 25A443&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;_________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; ILLINOIS, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on application for stay&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[December 23, 2025]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Alito, &lt;/span&gt;with whom&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Thomas &lt;/span&gt;joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “ ‘In our adversarial system of adjudication, we follow the principle of party presentation.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Clark &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Sweeney&lt;/em&gt;, 607 U. S. ___, ___ (2025) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;) (slip op., at 2) (quoting&lt;em&gt; United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Sineneng-Smith&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/590/371"&gt;590 U. S. 371&lt;/a&gt;, 375 (2020)).  If a party passes up what seems to us a promising argument, we do not assume the role of advocate.  Instead, we normally decide the questions that the parties choose to present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In this case, the Court has unnecessarily and unwisely departed from standard practice.  It raised an argument that respondents waived below, and it now rules in respondents’ favor on that ground.  To make matters worse, the Court reaches out and expresses tentative views on other highly important issues on which there is no relevant judicial precedent and on which we have received scant briefing and no oral argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; First, the Court suggests that the principal statutory provision involved in the case, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/12406#3"&gt;10 U. S. C. §12406(3)&lt;/a&gt;, contains a restriction that has no grounding in the statutory text, namely, that “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States” actually means “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States &lt;em&gt;for reasons other than the lack of lawful authority to do so&lt;/em&gt;.”  The Court in effect adds new language to the text Congress enacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Second, the Court implicitly suggests that §12406(3) does not constitute an “Act of Congress” within the meaning of that phrase in the Posse Comitatus Act.  §1385.  That is a surprising conclusion, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Third, the Court expresses the tentative view that the phrase “execute the laws of the United States” in §12406(3) does not include “protective functions” so that even if the National Guard is properly deployed under that provision, it may not be given the task of preventing potentially lethal attacks on civilian federal law enforcement officers or the takeover or destruction of Government facilities.  According to the Court’s apparent reasoning, National Guard members may enforce the immigration laws by, for example, arresting and processing aliens, but they may not perform the protective functions for which they are better suited.  That, too, is surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; On top of all this, the Court fails to explain why the President’s inherent constitutional authority to protect federal officers and property is not sufficient to justify the use of National Guard members in the relevant area for precisely that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I am not prepared at this point to express a definite view on these questions, but I have serious doubts about the correctness of the Court’s views.  And I strongly disagree with the manner in which the Court has disposed of this application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: justify; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The key statutory provision in this case, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/12406#3"&gt;10 U. S. C. §12406(3)&lt;/a&gt;, provides in relevant part that “[w]henever . . . the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,” he “may call into Federal service members and units of the National Guard of any  State in such numbers as he considers necessary to . . . execute those laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In the lower courts, the parties agreed that the phrase “regular forces” means civilian federal law enforcement officers, not military service members.  Respondents explicitly adopted this position in the District Court.  That court disagreed, but when the Government challenged this holding in the Seventh Circuit, respondents declined to defend the lower court’s interpretation, and the Seventh Circuit did not reach the issue.  The Government’s stay application in this Court asserted that any defense of the District Court’s interpretation had been waived, and respondents did not dispute either that assertion or the correctness of the Government’s contention that “regular forces” means federal civilian officers.  Thus, the argument that “regular forces” means the military was either waived or forfeited three times over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Ignoring this history, the Court ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs on the meaning of “regular forces.”  Respondents “[u]nderstandably . . . rode with an argument suggested by” the Court and argued, for the first time and contrary to their position below, that the “regular forces” means the military.  &lt;em&gt;Sineneng-Smith&lt;/em&gt;, 590 U. S., at 379.  The majority now accepts this eleventh-hour argument.  “Nevermind that [respondents] had presented a contrary theory of the case in the District Court.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 380.  For the Court, respondents’ “own arguments, differently directed, fell by the wayside, for they did not mesh with” the Court’s own “theory of the case.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 379.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We should decide this application based on the “party-presented controversy.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 380.  That controversy&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;centered on&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the District Court’s holding that, contrary to the President’s determination, civilian federal law enforcement officers were in fact able to execute federal laws in the Chicago area.  If the Court has doubts about the parties’ interpretation of the phrase “regular forces,” it could assume for  the sake of argument that the parties’ interpretation was correct and proceed on that basis.  The Court has done that on many occasions.  &lt;em&gt;E.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Warner Chappell Music, Inc. &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Nealy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/601/366"&gt;601 U. S. 366&lt;/a&gt;, 371 (2024) (assuming there is a discovery rule for copyright claims); &lt;em&gt;Financial Oversight and Management Bd. for P. R.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/339"&gt;598 U. S. 339&lt;/a&gt;, 345, 346 (2023) (“assum[ing] without deciding that Puerto Rico is immune from suit in federal district court and that [a financial oversight board] partakes of that immunity” because respondent “never argued” otherwise in the courts below); &lt;em&gt;Wisconsin Legislature&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Wisconsin Elections Comm’n&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/595/398"&gt;595 U. S. 398&lt;/a&gt;, 401 (2022) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;) (assuming without deciding that complying with the Voting Rights Act is a compelling interest); &lt;em&gt;McDonough &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Smith&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/109"&gt;588 U. S. 109&lt;/a&gt;, 115 (2019) (assuming without deciding that a due process fabricated-evidence claim may be asserted under Rev. Stat. §1979, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983"&gt;42 U. S. C. §1983&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In this case, the Court has no good reason to stray beyond the issues that the parties chose to present, and based on those arguments, the Court should grant the application.  There is no basis for rejecting the President’s determination that he was unable to execute the federal immigration laws using the civilian law enforcement resources at his command.  In concluding otherwise, the District Court likely committed both legal and factual error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: justify; text-align: center;"&gt;1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I will begin with the District Court’s understanding of the applicable law.  The District Court held that a President is “unable” to execute federal law within the meaning of &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/12406"&gt;10 U. S. C. §12406&lt;/a&gt; only if he is literally “incapable” of executing the law with the regular forces.  App. to Application 23a.  That interpretation is implausible.  If the term “regular forces” means federal civilian law enforcement officers, that  interpretation would mean that the President would have to conclude that the immigration laws could not be enforced in Illinois even if all other federal law enforcement activities were put on hold and every federal law enforcement officer in the country—including every FBI, DEA, Secret Service, and ATF agent, every postal inspector and deputy marshal, and all the law enforcement officers employed by other agencies—were transferred to that area and assigned that task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The District Court’s interpretation would lead to even more outlandish results if “regular forces” means the military.  In that case, a President could not call up the National Guard to execute the laws in one locale unless all the Nation’s military forces, if transferred to the area in question, would be incapable of executing the laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; A less extreme interpretation of “unable” is much more reasonable and consistent with the way the term is commonly used.  In everyday speech, a person may say that he or she is “unable” to perform an act simply because the adverse consequences of performing that act would be unacceptable.  For example, an attorney might tell a trial court judge that he or she is “unable” to start a trial on a particular day because the attorney is scheduled to argue a case in this Court on that date and no other attorney could prepare for the argument in time.  That attorney would be &lt;em&gt;capable &lt;/em&gt;of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;showing up for the trial on the day in question, but the attorney’s use of the term “unable” would be entirely natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The District Court’s interpretation of “unable” was implausible for an additional reason: It seems to prohibit deployment of the National Guard unless the President could not execute the laws to even the slightest extent.  The District Court took what it termed “a binary approach: ability or not, capability or not.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 68a.  As the Ninth Circuit has explained, however, “Section §12406(3) cannot plausibly be read to mean that so long as some amount of  execution of the laws remains possible, the statute cannot be invoked, regardless of how much execution of the laws remains thwarted or how much personal danger federal personnel face during operations.”  &lt;em&gt;Newsom &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Trump&lt;/em&gt;, 141 F. 4th 1032, 1051 (2025).  It is more reasonable to interpret §12406(3) to means that a President is “unable” to execute the laws when he is substantially impaired from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The District Court also erred in refusing to afford any deference to the President’s determination that calling up the National Guard was needed to execute federal law.  The most directly relevant Supreme Court precedent suggests that such a determination must be accepted by the courts.  In &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Mott&lt;/em&gt;, 12 Wheat. 19, 28 (1827), a militia member argued, among other things, that the standard for calling up the militia under the law in force at the time had not been met.  See Act of Feb. 28, 1795, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/1_Stat._424"&gt;1 Stat. 424&lt;/a&gt;.  Section 1 of that law governed use of the militia when the country is invaded or threatened with invasion, and §2, much like §12406(3), authorized use of the militia when “the execution” of federal law is obstructed.  Addressing the §1 standard, Justice Story’s opinion for the unanimous Court held that “the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen . . . belongs exclusively to the President.”  12 Wheat., at 30.  “[H]is decision,” the Court held, “is conclusive,” and therefore, application of the statute depends only on “his own judgment of the facts.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 30, 33; see also&lt;em&gt; Luther &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Borden&lt;/em&gt;, 7 How. 1, 43–45 (1849) (reaffirming the holding in &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt; and the unreviewability of the President’s decision to call up the militia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The District Court gave no weight to this precedent.  It saw &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt; as a relic, viewed its express holding as limited to the particular facts of the case, and thought it had been superseded by more recent political-question decisions. Such treatment of a Supreme Court precedent that has  never been overruled, narrowed, or questioned by this Court was inappropriate.  See &lt;em&gt;Mallory &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Norfolk Southern R. Co&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/600/122"&gt;600 U. S. 122&lt;/a&gt;, 136 (2023).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Even if &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt; does not dictate judicial acceptance of a President’s decision to call up the National Guard, both that precedent and a humble appreciation of the role of a single federal judge surely demanded that such a Presidential determination be given a modicum of deference.  The District Court afforded none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For these reasons, the District Court appears to have misunderstood what the law requires, and those legal errors alone justify a stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;C&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Once the proper legal framework is recognized, the President’s determination must almost certainly be sustained.  The Government’s declarations show that U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in and around Chicago have been the target of unprecedented sabotage and violence since June of this year.  Hundreds of rioters have converged at the Department of Homeland Security facility in Broadview, Illinois, the only intake and processing center for ICE operations in the Chicago area.  These rioters have been organized, gathering offsite and arriving in vans, then getting picked up several hours later by vans returning with new rioters.  They have arrived armed with shields, gas masks, protective padding, and other tools for physical combat.  And they have blocked entry and exit at the ICE facility, physically assaulted personnel attempting to enter or leave work, significantly damaged the building, and vandalized both Government and personally owned vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The resulting violence has endangered the lives of federal personnel.  Multiple rioters have been found with loaded guns, some of them semi-automatic.  Rioters have hit, punched, and shoved officers; thrown bottles, rocks, and  tear gas canisters at officers; attempted to grab officers’ firearms and munitions; pulled gas masks and tear gas canisters off the officers’ uniforms; targeted officers with bullhorns and whistles that can cause permanent hearing loss; aimed strobe lights and lasers at officers’ faces; and shot fireworks at officers.  On more than a dozen occasions, one rioter jumped on the hood of an incoming Government vehicle, and another took up a position immediately behind the vehicle.  When the vehicle stopped, other rioters ran up and slashed the vehicle’s tires.  As of early October, more than 30 federal officers had suffered injuries, and multiple officers had been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In a widely publicized event on October 4, a federal vehicle carrying Border Patrol agents was boxed in on a public road by 10 civilian vehicles, and 2 of those vehicles rammed the Government vehicle.  As the agents exited their vehicle, one of the civilian vehicles was driven directly at an agent, forcing the agent to fire in self-defense.  Hundreds of rioters then converged near the scene, throwing glass bottles and other dangerous objects at the agents.  A federal vehicle sent to assist the besieged agents was itself rammed.  Later in the day, a federal van was surrounded by rioters who slashed its tires, but no emergency assistance was available because of damage done to other Government vehicles earlier that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Even when not on duty, federal officers have been targeted.  They have been followed to their homes and “doxed.”  Officers and their families have been threatened, and their homes and vehicles have been vandalized.  Criminal enterprises have offered bounties for kidnapping or murdering immigration officers.  More than 20 officers have had their home addresses posted on social media, and posts have called for officials to be shot and killed on sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Local police departments have provided insufficient assistance.  When the October 4 ramming incident was reported to the Chicago Police Department, an internal  dispatch stated that “NO UNITS WILL RESPOND TO THIS.”  On September 13, when rioters threw rocks, slashed tires, and poured flour into a federal vehicle’s gas tank, ICE officers called the Broadview Police Department three times to ask for assistance.  The Broadview Police never responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In sum, injuries, threats, vandalism, and harassment have significantly impaired efforts to execute the laws.  The agencies have had to reallocate resources from enforcing the immigration laws to the provision of security for officers, the Broadview facility, and other Government property.  Even if the President’s assessment of the situation is given no deference, these facts adequately show that federal civilian offers were “unable to” execute the immigration laws under what appears to be the correct understanding of that standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;D&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The District Court disagreed but gave no good reason for doing so.  Respondents, as the parties seeking interim relief, bore the burden of proof.  See &lt;em&gt;Winter &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/555/7"&gt;555 U. S. 7&lt;/a&gt;, 22 (2008).  But instead of evaluating whether respondents had borne their burden, the District Court brushed aside the facts set out in the Government’s declarations (many of which were undisputed) based on two perceived weaknesses in those declarations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Neither of the District Court’s criticisms justified the wholesale dismissal of the Government’s declarations.  The court’s first criticism concerned the failure of two declarants to acknowledge that grand juries had declined to indict three of the individuals whose arrests were mentioned in the declarations.  The court saw the declarants’ failure to mention the grand juries’ actions as evidence of mendacity.  But the court did not take into account the dates on which the declarations were filed and the dates on which the  grand juries declined to indict, and it did not find that the declarants were aware of the grand juries’ actions.  Unless the declarants had such knowledge, however, there was no ground for impugning their candor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Second, the court suggested that the same declarants’ descriptions of the relevant events were exaggerated because they had submitted similar declarations in another case in which a different judge found that ICE officers had likely violated protestors’ &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; rights.  But again, more would have to be known before accepting this criticism.  What we do know is that the cited order in the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; case did not make any credibility findings and did not discuss the Government’s declarations at all, much less find them false.  See &lt;em&gt;Chicago Headline Club&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Noem&lt;/em&gt;, No. 1:25–cv–12173, (ND Ill., Oct. 9, 2025), ECF Doc. 43.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For these reasons, the validity of the District Court’s two criticisms is questionable, but even if they are taken at face value, they cannot justify the court’s wholesale refusal to credit the declarations’ uncontested description of serious and continuous violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Nor can the District Court’s decision be justified by conclusory statements in respondents’ declarations about the capability of state and local law enforcement to provide protection.  &lt;em&gt;E.g.&lt;/em&gt;, App. to Application 43a; Decl. of Major D. Orseno, No. 1:25–cv–12174, (ND Ill., Oct. 6, 2025), ECF Doc. 13–15.  Such statements provided no reason to doubt the occurrence of the incidents of violence described in the Government’s declarations.  And there is an obvious difference between the capabilities of state and local police and their willingness to assist.  Thus, even if we assume that a Presidential determination under §12406(3) is reviewable and not entitled to any special deference, the District Court erred in refusing to credit the unrefuted facts offered by the Government.  And those facts provide more than enough support for the President’s determination that he was  unable to enforce federal law in the Chicago area using federal civilian law enforcement officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Instead of abiding by the standard rule on party presentation, the Court took it upon itself to raise the question whether the parties’ understanding of “regular forces” was correct.  And taking a cue from this Court, respondents abandoned their position below and switched to the argument that the phrase “regular forces” refers to the military, not civilian federal law enforcement.  The Court tentatively agrees with respondents’ new argument, but even if that is correct, it does not follow that the President exceeded his lawful authority when he called the National Guard into federal service to assist in executing federal law in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Regardless of how the term “regular forces” is defined, the President appears to have complied with the requirements of §12406(3).  The provision asks whether the “President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”  And the President said unequivocally that he had “determined that the regular forces of the United States are not sufficient to ensure the laws of the United States are faithfully executed . . . in Chicago.”  Memorandum for Secretary of War et al., No. 1:25–cv–12174 (ND Ill.), ECF Doc. 62–1, pp. 16–17 (Presidential Memo).  Not only is this statement sufficient on its face, but under the presumption of regularity, the Court must presume that the President properly arrived at his determination.  See &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;, 12 Wheat., at 32–33 (“When the President exercises an authority confided to him by law, the presumption is, that it is exercised in pursuance of law”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The majority does not explain why the President’s declaration falls short.  Instead, it breezily concludes that a President’s inability to execute the law cannot be established  unless “the military could &lt;em&gt;legally &lt;/em&gt;execute the laws.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 2 (emphasis added).  In effect, the Court adds new language to the statute so that it now requires that a President be “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States &lt;em&gt;for reasons other than the lack of lawful authority to do so.&lt;/em&gt;”  We have no authority to add this new language to the text Congress enacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The sole requirement set out in the text of §12406(3) is that the President must be “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”  That text says nothing about the cause of the President’s inability to execute the laws, and in ordinary usage, it is common to say that a person is “unable to” perform an act when the obstacle is a rule of law.  For example, it would be natural to say that a person who is fully capable of operating a motor vehicle is nevertheless “unable to” drive to work because his or her license has been suspended.  Or, to take one more example, it would be natural to say that a federal district court is “unable to” adjudicate a case in which the plaintiff sues a citizen of the same State under state law.  See &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1332"&gt;28 U. S. C. §1332&lt;/a&gt;.  This use of the term “unable” would be entirely appropriate even if the judge, as will almost certainly be the case, is fully capable of handling such a case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; By the same token, if we apply the ordinary meaning of “unable to” in a case involving §12406(3), a President may be “unable to” use the military to execute the laws due to either practical &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;legal constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Even if §12406(3) contained the extra requirement that the Court adds, there would be reasonable grounds for concluding that the President had authority to take the actions at issue.  Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge as much.  It notes that the President invokes his “inherent constitutional authority . . . to use the military to protect federal personnel and property,” &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 3, and it cites with  apparent approval a body of Office of Legal Counsel opinions sanctioning this understanding of inherent Presidential power.  Authority To Use Troops To Prevent Interference With Federal Employees by Mayday Demonstrations and Consequent Impairment of Government Functions, 1 Supp. Op. OLC 343, 343–344 (1971) (citing earlier opinions); see also &lt;em&gt;In re Neagle&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/135/1"&gt;135 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 58–59, 67 (1890) (recognizing an inherent authority to protect federal judges); &lt;em&gt;In re Debs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/158/564"&gt;158 U. S. 564&lt;/a&gt;, 582 (1895) (recognizing an inherent authority to protect highways for the passage of interstate commerce and mail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; That is what happened here: The President authorized the National Guard to “perform those protective activities that the Secretary of War determines are reasonably necessary to ensure the execution of Federal law in Illinois, and to protect Federal property in Illinois.”  Presidential Memo. 17.  Although the Court recognizes this inherent Presidential power, it does not explain why it is not sufficient to satisfy the new element that the Court has added to §12406(3).&lt;a href="#DISSENT_4-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Court seems to suggest that the Posse Comitatus Act, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1385"&gt;18 U. S. C. §1385&lt;/a&gt;, stands in the way of what the President did here, but that is puzzling.  Does the Court mean to suggest that the Posse Comitatus Act somehow limited a President’s inherent &lt;em&gt;constitutional&lt;/em&gt; authority?  That is certainly not Congress’s view.  See &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/6/466#a_4"&gt;6 U. S. C. §466(a)(4)&lt;/a&gt; (“[B]y  its express terms, the Posse Comitatus Act is not a complete barrier to the use of the Armed Forces for a range of domestic purposes, including law enforcement functions, when the use of the Armed Forces is authorized by Act of Congress or the President determines that the use of the Armed Forces is required to fulfill the President’s obligations under the Constitution to respond promptly in time of war, insurrection, or other serious emergency”).  And in any event, the Posse Comitatus Act expressly permits the use of the military to execute the laws when permitted by an Act of Congress,&lt;a href="#DISSENT_4-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and §12406(3) is of course part of such an Act.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_4-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Court finds the Posse Comitatus Act relevant largely because the same phrase—“to execute the laws”—also appears in  §12406(3).  The Court’s reasoning appears to go as follows.  Under a position long taken by the Government, the Posse Comitatus Act does not forbid the use of the military for “protective functions.”  This must mean that the performance of such functions does not constitute the  execution of the laws.  Section 12406(3) allows the use of federalized National Guard members “to execute the laws.”  Therefore, it follows that the National Guard may not be used for protective functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Court’s reasoning rests on the &lt;em&gt;presumption&lt;/em&gt; that a phrase has the same meaning when it is used in closely related statutory provisions, but that presumption is not conclusive, and there are reasons to question its application here.  OLC’s interpretation of the Posse Comitatus Act is based heavily on the history and purpose of that Act, not the ordinary meaning of the phrase “execute the laws,” which easily encompasses protective functions.  See 1 Supp. Op. OLC, at 344 (examining the “history,” “purpose,” and “desig[n]” of the Posse Comitatus Act).  Moreover, one of OLC’s reasons for narrowly interpreting the Posse Comitatus Act’s reach was to avoid intrusion on the President’s inherent Article II powers and duties.  See &lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt; (noting the “President’s constitutional duty to protect [federal] functioning” and “inherent authority to use troops, if necessary, to carry out this duty”).  Interpreting the phrase “execute the laws” in §12406 in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms would not pose any similar problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; On the contrary, that interpretation would be consistent with the way the phrase is used elsewhere.  Under Article II, §3 of the Constitution, the President must “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” and laws protecting federal officers and property are not excepted.  Nor do we read the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the use of militia and armed forces to “enforce the laws,” as preventing the President from ordering troops to serve protective functions.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/252"&gt;10 U. S. C. §252&lt;/a&gt;.  It is therefore entirely possible that the phrase has different meanings in §12406 and the Posse Comitatus Act, especially since what §12406 authorizes is not the use of the regular military but the National Guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We should not hastily dismiss that possibility because interpreting §12406(3) in the way the Court suggests would  have very strange consequences that Congress is unlikely to have intended.  Under the Court’s interpretation, National Guard members could arrest and process aliens who are subject to deportation, but they would lack statutory authorization to perform purely protective functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Our country has traditionally been wary of using soldiers as domestic police, but it has been comfortable with their use for purely protective purposes.  The Court’s interpretation of §12406(3) assumes that Congress meant for that provision to turn this approach on its head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In conclusion, the Court should have decided this application based on the arguments the parties chose to present, and on that basis should have granted a stay.  Injecting another issue into the matter was unwise, and suggesting views on a host of important questions without adequate briefing, consideration, or explanation is imprudent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Whatever one may think about the current administration’s enforcement of the immigration laws or the way ICE has conducted its operations, the protection of federal officers from potentially lethal attacks should not be thwarted.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I therefore respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_4-1ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;  If §12406(3) is triggered only when a President determines that he is unable to execute the law by using the military, it is not easy to see how a court could assess and reject such a determination.  As discussed, inability under §12406 should likely be interpreted to require no more than serious detrimental consequences, and therefore the statutory predicate should likely be regarded as satisfied whenever the deployment of military units for the purpose of executing the laws at home would have such consequences.  Assessing the impact of such a deployment would require a survey and analysis of all the Nation’s military needs, and only a President and those under his command are equipped to make such an assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_4-2ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  The Act states: “Whoever, &lt;em&gt;except in cases and under circumstances expressly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;authorized by&lt;/em&gt; the Constitution or &lt;em&gt;Act of Congress&lt;/em&gt;, willfully uses any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.”  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1385"&gt;18 U. S. C. §1385&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_4-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  I would not take for granted that the Posse Comitatus Act applies to federalized National Guard units, another question that this Court has never addressed.  Indeed, the Act’s enumeration of other military components—“the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, [and] the Space Force”—makes the omission of the National Guard quite notable.  If, as the Court states, the term “regular forces” in §12406 likely means the military, Congress clearly views the military and federalized National Guard units as distinct entities.  Otherwise, §12406 would nonsensically say that the President may call up the National Guard when the National Guard is unable to execute the laws.  It is therefore not obvious that the Posse Comitatus Act would ever apply to federalized National Guard units, as opposed to the regular military.  As §12405 makes clear, some of the laws and regulations governing “members of the Regular Army or Regular Air Force” are not applicable to the National Guard “when called into Federal service.”  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/12405"&gt;10 U. S. C. §12405&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt;, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This case touches on sensitive and gravely consequential questions concerning what roles the National Guard and U. S. military may play in domestic law enforcement.  To be sure, as the parties observe, Congress has supplied us with some relevant statutory guidance in &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/12406#3"&gt;10 U. S. C. §12406(3)&lt;/a&gt;.  But, as my colleagues’ writings attest, that statute raises as many questions as it answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Take just some examples.  Before calling up the National Guard under §12406(3), must the President be unable to execute the laws merely with federal civilian law enforcement personnel—or must he be unable to do so even with military troops?  Is a Presidential declaration that he is unable with the regular forces to execute the law judicially reviewable—and, if so, to what extent and under what standard?  Does §12406(3) provide standalone authority permitting the President to deploy the Guard, and how does it interact with other statutes in the field, such as the Posse Comitatus Act, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1385"&gt;18 U. S. C. §1385&lt;/a&gt;, and the Insurrection Act, &lt;a href="/uscode/text/10"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; U. S. C. §§&lt;a href="/uscode/text/10/251"&gt;251&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href="/uscode/text/10/255"&gt;255&lt;/a&gt;?  What, if any, inherent Article II power does the President have to deploy the Guard to protect federal personnel or property, and how might that inform the interpretation of §12406(3)?  And if, as all parties seem to assume, today’s Guard is the successor to the militia of the founding era, how far can this inherent Presidential authority extend before it intrudes on Congress’s  prerogative to decide when the militia may be used to execute the laws?  See Art. I, §8, cl. 15.  If all those questions were not fraught enough, an even graver one lurks here too:  When, if ever, may the federal government deploy the professional military for domestic law enforcement purposes consistent with the Constitution?  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., Art. IV, §4; Amdt. 14, §5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In the present posture of this case, I am not comfortable venturing an answer to any of those questions.  This Court has never decided a case about the meaning of §12406(3), let alone explored its interaction with other statutes in the field or the Constitution.  Nor do we have much help on many of these matters from the parties’ briefs before us, understandably given that this case comes to us in an interlocutory posture on a highly compressed schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Under these circumstances, caution seems to me key, and I would decide this application narrowly, based only on those few arguments the parties preserved and the evidentiary record as it stands.  See &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Sineneng-Smith&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/590/371"&gt;590 U. S. 371&lt;/a&gt;, 375 (2020).  In their initial briefing before this Court, the parties proceeded on the premise that §12406(3) statutorily permits the President to call up and deploy the National Guard when he is unable to execute federal law with civilian federal law enforcement officials.  Proceeding on that same premise, I believe the declarations federal law enforcement officials submitted below support the grant of a stay for substantially the reasons given in Parts I–A, B–1, C, and D of &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Alito’&lt;/span&gt;s&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;opinion.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 2–11.  But I would hazard no opinion beyond that, leaving instead all the weighty questions outlined above for another case where they are properly preserved and can receive the full airing they so clearly deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 24–5438. Argued October 14, 2025—Decided January 9, 2026&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Petitioner Michael S. Bowe is serving a 24-year sentence in federal custody after pleading guilty in 2008 to three offenses: (1) conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery; (2) attempted Hobbs Act robbery; and (3) using a firearm in relation to a “crime of violence” as defined in &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924#c_1_A"&gt;18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)&lt;/a&gt;.  Bowe’s §924(c) conviction carried a mandatory 10-year sentence to be served consecutively to his sentence for the robbery offenses.  To have been properly convicted under §924(c), at least one of Bowe’s other offenses must qualify as a “crime of violence” under one of two definitional clauses in §924(c): the “elements clause,” §924(c)(3)(A), or the “residual clause,” §924(c)(3)(B).  But decisions issued years after Bowe’s conviction call into question whether either clause can support his §924(c) conviction.  See &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/445"&gt;588 U. S. 445&lt;/a&gt;, 470 (residual clause void for vagueness); &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Taylor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/845"&gt;596 U. S. 845&lt;/a&gt;, 860 (attempted Hobbs Act robbery is not a crime of violence under the elements clause).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  This case concerns Bowe’s efforts to obtain postconviction relief from the mandatory consecutive 10-year sentence imposed under §924(c).  A comprehensive statutory scheme governs when and how state and federal prisoners can seek postconviction relief in federal court.  See &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2254"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2254&lt;/a&gt; (state prisoners); §2255 (federal prisoners).  Particularly relevant here, under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), second or subsequent efforts at obtaining postconviction relief require the prisoner first to seek certification from a court of appeals that the filing meets threshold conditions before a prisoner can proceed in a district court.  See §2244 (authorization requests by state prisoners); §2255(h) (successive-motion requests by federal prisoners).  While §§2244 and 2255(h) have distinct  requirements, §2255(h) cross-references some of the procedures in §2244 for how a “panel of the appropriate court of appeals” “certifie[s]” a second or successive filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  Bowe first sought §2255 relief in 2016, arguing that §924(c)’s residual clause was unconstitutional.  The District Court denied the motion, reasoning that—regardless of the residual clause’s constitutionality—Bowe’s §924(c) conviction was proper because attempted Hobbs Act robbery qualified as a “crime of violence” under the elements clause.  In 2019, after &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt;, Bowe sought permission from the Eleventh Circuit under §2255(h) to file a second or successive motion.  A three-judge panel found that Bowe had not met §2255(h)’s threshold conditions.  Although the panel acknowledged that &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt; announced a new, retroactive constitutional rule (one of the two statutory gateways for successive motions under §2255(h)(2)), it held that Bowe could not make a prima facie showing that his §924(c) conviction was unconstitutional because then-binding Circuit precedent still treated attempted Hobbs Act robbery as a “crime of violence” under the elements clause.  After &lt;em&gt;Taylor&lt;/em&gt; was decided in 2022, Bowe once again sought authorization under §2255(h), arguing that &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Taylor&lt;/em&gt; leave none of his convictions as a valid predicate “crime of violence” under §924(c).  A panel dismissed the part of Bowe’s request resting on &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt;, reasoning that the claim had been “presented in a prior application” and that the panel lacked jurisdiction over such old claims under §2244(b)(1).  The panel also denied the part of Bowe’s request that rested on &lt;em&gt;Taylor&lt;/em&gt;, concluding that &lt;em&gt;Taylor&lt;/em&gt; did not announce a new constitutional rule within the meaning of §2255(h)(2).  Bowe returned to the Eleventh Circuit several times, seeking authorization to pursue postconviction relief, initial hearing en banc, and reversal of Circuit precedent applying §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar to federal prisoners’ successive §2255 motions.  He also requested certification of the question whether §2244(b)(1) applies to federal prisoners.  See §1254(2).  Bowe’s requests were denied.  Bowe eventually filed this petition for certiorari, pointing out a circuit split: Six Circuits apply §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar to federal prisoners, while three do not.  The Court granted review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Held&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; 1. The Court has jurisdiction because §2244(b)(3)(E) does not bar this Court’s review of a federal prisoner’s request to file a second or successive §2255 motion.  Pp. 5–19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  (a) Section 2244(b)(3)(E) provides that the denial of authorization “to file a second or successive application” shall not be the subject of a certiorari petition.  That provision does not apply to federal prisoners.  It is housed within §2244, which imposes several strict requirements that apply only to state prisoners.  It also speaks only to a “second or successive application,” §2244(b)(3)(E), but unlike state prisoners who  file such “applications,” federal prisoners file “motions,” see §2255(e). Pp. 5–8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  (b) The Government contends that §2255(h)’s cross-reference to §2244—providing that a successive motion must be “certified as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals to contain” the content requirements in §2255(h)—also imports §2244’s certiorari bar.  But §2255(h)’s cross-reference, coupled with its context, does not provide the clear indication needed to strip this Court of jurisdiction.  Given the broad grant of certiorari jurisdiction to the Court, see §1254(1), Congress must speak clearly if it seeks to impose exceptions to that jurisdiction.  In &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/540/375"&gt;540 U. S. 375&lt;/a&gt;, a case also brought by a federal prisoner, the Court held that §2244(b)(3)(E) posed no bar to its review, explaining that the Government’s reading would close the Court’s doors to a class of habeas petitioners “without any clear indication” that Congress intended such a result.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 381.  The same “clear indication” necessary in &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; to strip the Court of jurisdiction is required here: The §2244(b)(3)(E) issue arises in the same context and the Government argues that the very same provision bars the Court’s review in this case.  This clear indication is not a “magic words” requirement; it simply asks whether text and structure unambiguously show that Congress intended to prevent the Court’s exercise of its certiorari jurisdiction.  A provision that can reasonably be read more than one way in context is not sufficiently clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Section 2255(h)’s cross-reference does not provide the clear indication of intent required to strip the Court of jurisdiction.  The language of the cross-reference is both narrow and specific.  It says that a second or successive §2255 motion “must be certified as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals to contain” one of two threshold content requirements.  It incorporates only the provisions in §2244 that “provid[e]” for how a “panel of the appropriate court of appeals” “certifie[s]” a second or successive filing and directs that those procedures be used to evaluate whether the filing “contain[s]” the content requirements listed in §2255(h).  Section 2244(b)(3)(E) is not one of those provisions, and it has nothing to do with the content requirements in §2255(h).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For these reasons and others, whether §2244(b)(3)(E)’s certiorari bar falls within the scope of §2255(h)’s cross-reference is at most ambiguous.  Ambiguous language cannot provide the required clear indication, and the Government’s remaining arguments do not supply the necessary clarity that the text lacks.  The Government also suggests that it would make little sense to bar certiorari review of authorization decisions concerning state prisoners but not federal ones.  That  argument carries little weight when the governing standard requires Congress to speak clearly.  Moreover, Congress treated state and federal prisoners differently across AEDPA, with state prisoners often facing far higher hurdles to relief.  Allowing further review in this Court is thus consistent with both AEDPA’s purposes and practical considerations.  Pp. 8–19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  2. Section 2244(b)(1) does not apply to second or successive motions filed under §2255(h) by federal prisoners challenging their convictions or sentences.  Pp. 19–25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  (a) The text of §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar states that “[a] claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.”  State prisoners alone file habeas corpus applications under §2254.  That specific reference to §2254 was deliberate: Elsewhere in this very section, Congress expressly distinguishes §2254 “applications” from §2255 “motions.”  §2266(a); see also §§2253(c)(1)(A)–(B) (distinguishing state habeas proceedings from proceedings under §2255).  When interpreting statutes, the Court presumes that “differences in language like this convey differences in meaning.”  &lt;em&gt;Henson&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Santander Consumer USA Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/582/79"&gt;582 U. S. 79&lt;/a&gt;, 86.  By its plain terms, §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar applies only to state prisoners.  P. 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  (b) Section 2255(h)’s cross-reference to §2244 does not make §2244(b)(1) applicable to federal prisoners’ successive §2255 motions.  Amicus contends that §2255(h) incorporates §2244, including §2244(b)(3)(C), which requires a panel to determine that “the application makes a prima facie showing that [it] satisfies the requirements of this subsection.”  From here, one of the “requirements of . . . subsection” (b) is §2244(b)(1).  Accordingly, amicus argues, following this chain of cross-references leads to the conclusion that §2244(b)(1) must apply to federal prisoners.  But that position is erroneous under the same reasoning that explains why the Court has jurisdiction.  Section 2255(h)’s cross-reference incorporates the procedures in §2244 only as they relate to how a panel certifies a second or successive filing.  At bottom, the best textual reading of both §2255(h) and §2244(b) is that, when a federal prisoner moves for authorization, a panel can authorize the filing if the filing makes a prima facie showing that it satisfies one of the two grounds in §2255(h), the “two—and only two—conditions in which a second or successive §2255 motion may proceed.”  &lt;em&gt;Jones&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hendrix&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/465"&gt;599 U. S. 465&lt;/a&gt;, 477.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The argument that Congress meant for AEDPA to treat second or successive filings by federal and state prisoners the same fails.  AEDPA is replete with examples of Congress treating state and federal prisoners differently—including in the context of limitations on second or successive filings.  Any concern associated with Congress allowing  old-claim litigation for federal prisoners is overstated given that all claims, even the repeat ones, must meet the “strictly limited” threshold requirements of §2255(h), &lt;em&gt;Jones&lt;/em&gt;, 599 U. S., at 476, and should they survive that review, they must still conform with the demanding statute of limitations contained in §2255(f ), &lt;em&gt;Dodd&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/545/353"&gt;545 U. S. 353&lt;/a&gt;, 359.  Very few claims will satisfy either, let alone both.  The Court leaves it to the Eleventh Circuit to determine in the first instance whether Bowe should receive authorization to file a second or successive motion under the correct standard.  Pp. 20–25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;[January 9, 2026]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt; delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Congress has created a comprehensive scheme to address when and how state and federal prisoners can seek postconviction relief in federal courts.  A state prisoner can file an application for a writ of habeas corpus under &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2254"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2254&lt;/a&gt;.  A federal prisoner, by contrast, can file a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence under §2255.  Each provision contains its own procedural and substantive requirements that an individual must satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This case concerns the more complicated situation when a prisoner returns to federal court after a prior attempt for relief has failed.  In this situation, Congress has enlisted the courts of appeals to play a gatekeeping role in the consideration of second or successive filings brought by federal and state prisoners.  Under this system, before a prisoner can bring such a filing in a district court, a court of appeals must certify that the filing meets certain threshold conditions.  Section 2244 governs authorization requests made by state prisoners, and §2255(h), in turn, governs requests made by federal prisoners.  The two have distinct requirements, but through a limited cross-reference in §2255(h) to §2244 for how a filing is “certified” by a “panel,” Congress  has borrowed certain of the procedures that apply to state prisoners and applies them to federal prisoners too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This case presents two questions regarding which aspects of §2244 fall within the scope of §2255(h)’s cross-reference.  The first is whether §2244(b)(3)(E), which prohibits the “denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application” from being the “subject of a petition for . . . a writ of certiorari,” bars this Court’s review of authorization decisions concerning the motions of federal prisoners.  If it does, this Court would lack jurisdiction to hear this case.  The Court holds that it does not.  In the narrow cross-reference to the procedures in §2244, Congress has not clearly indicated that it intended to incorporate §2244(b)(3)(E)’s certiorari bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The second question is whether §2244(b)(1), which directs courts to dismiss a claim “presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application,” applies to motions filed by federal prisoners.  It does not: Section 2244(b)(1), by its express terms, applies only to state prisoners’ habeas applications under §2254, not to federal prisoners’ motions under §2255.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Petitioner Michael S. Bowe is in federal custody.  In 2008, he pleaded guilty to three offenses: (1) conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1951#a"&gt;18 U. S. C. §1951(a)&lt;/a&gt;; (2) attempt to commit Hobbs Act robbery, &lt;em&gt;ibid&lt;/em&gt;.; and (3) the use, carrying, brandishing, or discharge of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, §924(c)(1)(A).   Bowe received a 24-year sentence; 10 of those years were imposed because of the §924(c) conviction, which carried a mandatory 10-year sentence consecutive to the sentence for the predicate robbery offenses.  See §924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  Bowe did not appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In the decade since, this Court has issued several decisions that have called Bowe’s §924(c) conviction into  question.  To appreciate the implications of those decisions, it is important first to understand how §924(c) operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Section 924(c) applies if, as relevant here, an individual commits a qualifying “crime of violence” with a firearm.  A “crime of violence,” in turn, is defined in two ways.  Under the “elements clause,” it is a “felony” that “has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.”  §924(c)(3)(A).  Under the “residual clause,” it is a felony “that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.”  §924(c)(3)(B).  For Bowe to have been properly convicted under §924(c)—and thus to have received the accompanying 10-year consecutive sentence—his conviction for either conspiracy or attempt to commit Hobbs Act robbery must qualify as a crime of violence under either the elements or residual clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Today, it is likely that neither clause would permissibly support Bowe’s §924(c) conviction.  In &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/445"&gt;588 U. S. 445 (2019)&lt;/a&gt;, this Court held that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 470.  In &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Taylor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/845"&gt;596 U. S. 845 (2022)&lt;/a&gt;, the Court held that attempted Hobbs Act robbery does not qualify as a crime of violence under the elements clause.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 860.  Eleventh Circuit precedent is also clear that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery does not satisfy the elements clause.  See &lt;em&gt;Brown &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/942_F.3d_1069"&gt;942 F. 3d 1069&lt;/a&gt;, 1075 (2019) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).  If sentenced today, therefore, Bowe likely would not be subject to the 10-year mandatory consecutive sentence that he is now serving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Nevertheless, the timing of this Court’s decisions, coupled with the timing of Bowe’s efforts to take advantage of them, have produced procedural complications that have so far prevented relief, leading to this appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Bowe, acting &lt;em&gt;pro se&lt;/em&gt;, initially sought postconviction relief under §2255 in 2016, before the Court decided &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt;,  arguing that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague.  A District Court rejected Bowe’s claim, in part, because regardless of the residual clause’s constitutionality, attempted Hobbs Act robbery qualified as a crime of violence under §924(c)’s elements clause.  App. 43.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; After &lt;em&gt;Davis &lt;/em&gt;was decided in 2019, Bowe sought permission from the Eleventh Circuit to file a second or successive motion.  See §2255(h).  A three-judge panel declined to authorize Bowe’s motion.  Although the panel acknowledged that &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt; had announced a new, retroactive rule of constitutional law, which is one of two grounds on which a second or successive motion can proceed, see §2255(h)(2), it held that Bowe could not “make a &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; showing that his §924(c) conviction and sentence [were] unconstitutional” because under then-prevailing Eleventh Circuit precedent, “attempted Hobbs Act robbery” still qualified as a crime of violence under the elements clause, App. 52–54.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Then, after &lt;em&gt;Taylor&lt;/em&gt; was decided in 2022, Bowe once again sought permission from the Eleventh Circuit to file a second or successive motion.  This time, Bowe argued that under &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Taylor&lt;/em&gt;, none of his convictions qualified as a predicate “crime of violence.”  A three-judge panel dismissed the part of Bowe’s request that rested on &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt;, reasoning that because the claim was “presented in a prior application” to file a second or successive motion, the panel lacked jurisdiction over it under §2244(b)(1).  App. 59–60.  The panel also denied the part of Bowe’s request that rested on &lt;em&gt;Taylor&lt;/em&gt;, concluding that &lt;em&gt;Taylor&lt;/em&gt; did not announce a new constitutional rule as needed to secure relief under §2255(h)(2).  App. 59–60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Bowe did not stop there.  A few months later, he again sought authorization to file a second or successive motion, again relying on &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Taylor&lt;/em&gt;.  This time, Bowe also moved for initial hearing en banc.  As relevant, he asked the Eleventh Circuit to overturn its precedent holding that §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar applies to federal prisoners’  successive §2255 motions.  In Bowe’s view, that bar applies only to state prisoners, not federal prisoners like him.  A three-judge panel dismissed Bowe’s request for authorization, citing §2244(b)(1), and the Eleventh Circuit denied Bowe’s motion for initial hearing en banc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Bowe then moved for an original writ of habeas corpus in this Court.  It was denied.  &lt;em&gt;In re Bowe&lt;/em&gt;, 601 U. S. ___ (2024).  Bowe returned to the Eleventh Circuit, seeking authorization, initial hearing en banc, and certification of the question whether §2244(b)(1) applies to federal prisoners.  See §1254(2) (allowing courts of appeals to certify questions of law to the Supreme Court).  As before, a three-judge panel dismissed Bowe’s request for authorization, relying on §2244(b)(1).  The panel also declined to certify the question Bowe requested, and the full Eleventh Circuit denied his motion for initial hearing en banc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Finally, Bowe filed a petition for a writ of certiorari.  The Eleventh Circuit is one of six Circuits that apply §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar to federal prisoners.  Three Circuits do not.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  The Court granted certiorari to resolve the issue.  See &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/604/1096"&gt;604 U. S. 1096 (2025)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As a threshold matter, the Government argues that the Court cannot resolve the Circuit split concerning §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar because the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case under §2244(b)(3)(E).  That provision states that the “denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application . . . shall not be the subject of a petition for . . . a writ of certiorari.”  See &lt;em&gt;Hawaii&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Office of Hawaiian Affairs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/163"&gt;556 U. S. 163&lt;/a&gt;, 171 (2009) (“Before turning to the merits, we first must address our jurisdiction”).  If Bowe were in state custody, then the Government would be correct.  See &lt;em&gt;Stewart&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Martinez-Villareal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/523/637"&gt;523 U. S. 637&lt;/a&gt;, 641 (1998).  He is not.  Section 2244(b)(3)(E) does not prevent the Court’s review because the certiorari bar does not clearly apply to motions filed by federal prisoners like Bowe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), “Congress established a ‘gatekeeping’ mechanism for the consideration of ‘second or successive’ ” filings “in the federal courts.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 641 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Felker&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Turpin&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/518/651"&gt;518 U. S. 651&lt;/a&gt;, 657 (1996)).  The associated procedural and substantive requirements are “stringent.”  &lt;em&gt;Burton&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/549/147"&gt;549 U. S. 147&lt;/a&gt;, 152 (2007) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; State prisoners looking to file a second or successive application must comply with §2244(b), which provides in relevant part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “(3)(A) Before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “(B) A motion in the court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider a second or successive application shall be determined by a three-judge panel of the court of appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “(C) The court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of this subsection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  “(D) The court of appeals shall grant or deny the authorization to file a second or successive application not later than 30 days after the filing of the motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “(E) The grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “(4) A district court shall dismiss any claim presented in a second or successive application that the court of appeals has authorized to be filed unless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies the requirements of this section.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; By comparison, a federal prisoner seeking to file a second or successive motion must satisfy §2255(h).  &lt;em&gt;Jones&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hendrix&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/465"&gt;599 U. S. 465&lt;/a&gt;, 477–478 (2023).  That provision states in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “A second or successive motion must be certified as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals to contain—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;“(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;“(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Unlike the provisions governing authorization decisions for state prisoners, §2255(h) does not mention this Court’s certiorari jurisdiction, let alone purport to limit it.  Nor does §2244(b)(3)(E) readily apply to federal prisoners on its face: Section 2244, overall, imposes several strict requirements that apply only to state prisoners with the aim of  facilitating finality,&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the certiorari bar in particular speaks to “second or successive applications,” which federal prisoners do not file, see §2255(e) (federal prisoners must file “motions” for habeas relief, not applications).  Whether the Court has jurisdiction therefore turns on the scope of §2255(h)’s cross-reference to §2244.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In the Government’s view, the cross-reference captures all of §§2244(b)(3) and (b)(4), including the certiorari bar in §2244(b)(3)(E).  Although the Government is correct that the cross-reference incorporates some of the provisions it identifies, the Government is wrong that it also incorporates the certiorari bar.  That is because the cross- reference, coupled with its context, does not provide the clear indication needed to strip this Court of jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: justify; text-align: center;"&gt;1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This Court has certiorari jurisdiction over any “[c]as[e] in the courts of appeals . . . upon the petition of any party to any civil or criminal case, before or after rendition of judgment or decree.”  §1254(1).  Given that broad grant of jurisdiction, Congress must speak clearly if it seeks to impose exceptions to that jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/540/375"&gt;540 U. S. 375 (2003)&lt;/a&gt;, Castro (a federal prisoner) filed a motion for postconviction relief in Federal District Court.  He had previously filed a motion, &lt;em&gt;pro se&lt;/em&gt;, attacking his conviction, but he had not specifically labeled it as a §2255 motion.  The District Court construed Castro’s previous filing as his first §2255 motion and the second filing before it as a second §2255 motion.  Because  Castro did not receive authorization from the Court of Appeals before filing the second motion, the court dismissed it.  The court, however, granted Castro a certificate of appealability as to its determination that the motion was his second one.  See §2253(c).  The Court of Appeals later affirmed the dismissal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This Court granted certiorari to address the recharacterization of Castro’s first filing.  The Court also asked the parties whether §2244(b)(3)(E) barred its review.  Like here, the Government argued that it did.  In the Government’s view, the Court of Appeals had denied Castro authorization when it affirmed the District Court’s dismissal, making that “denial” the “subject” of his “petition for . . . certiorari” for the purposes of §2244(b)(3)(E).  The Court accepted that characterization of the proceedings below for the sake of argument, yet disagreed that §2244(b)(3)(E) posed a bar to its review.  &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;, 540 U. S&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;, at 380.  That was because the “subject” of Castro’s petition was not the denial of authorization, but rather “the lower courts’ refusal to recognize that [the] §2255 motion [was] his first, not his second.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As relevant here, the Court stressed a fatal flaw with the Government’s argument.  As it explained, “reading the statute as the Government suggest[ed]” to bar jurisdiction in that case “would close our doors to a class of habeas petitioners seeking review without any clear indication that  such was Congress’ intent.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 381; cf. &lt;em&gt;Hertz Corp.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Friend&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/559/77"&gt;559 U. S. 77&lt;/a&gt;, 83–84 (2010) (declining to read “silence or ambiguous language as modifying or limiting [the Court’s] pre-existing [certiorari] jurisdiction”).  That conclusion was also “difficult to reconcile with the basic principle that ‘we read limitations on our jurisdiction to review narrowly.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;, 540 U. S., at 381 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Utah&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Evans&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/536/452"&gt;536 U. S. 452&lt;/a&gt;, 463 (2002)).&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Because a “clear indication” was necessary in &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; to strip the Court of jurisdiction, a “clear indication” is required here: The issue arises in the same context and the Government argues that the very same provision bars the Court’s review in this case.  This clear indication, importantly, is not a so-called “magic words” requirement.  It simply asks whether the text and structure support the unambiguous understanding that Congress intended to prevent this Court’s exercise of its certiorari jurisdiction.  If a provision can reasonably be read multiple ways given its content and context, it is not sufficiently clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The dissent contends that this clear-indication requirement comes from “thin air.”  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 11–16 (opinion of &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt;, J.).  As just explained, however, it comes from &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; itself. It also draws support from this Court’s historical practice of declining to read ambiguous statutes to limit its certiorari jurisdiction, which even the dissent acknowledges.  See &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 15–16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The dissent also argues that this clear-indication requirement must be mistaken because it is not derived from principles of constitutional avoidance.  Constitutional avoidance, however, is not the only possible source of a rule like &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;’s.  This Court also has required Congress to speak clearly in other contexts when Congress wishes to do something that the Constitution allows.  For example, the Court will interpret a “procedural requirement as jurisdictional only if Congress ‘clearly states’ that it is.”  &lt;em&gt;Boechler&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Commissioner&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/199"&gt;596 U. S. 199&lt;/a&gt;, 203 (2022).  In that context, “Congress need not ‘incant magic words,’ but the ‘traditional tools of statutory construction must plainly show that Congress imbued a procedural bar with jurisdictional consequences.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;. (citation omitted).  Requiring this showing is driven by the harsh consequences of finding a procedural requirement jurisdictional, even though Congress, of course, maintains the power to impose such consequences.  See &lt;em&gt;Arbaugh&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Y &amp;amp; H Corp.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/546/500"&gt;546 U. S. 500&lt;/a&gt;, 514–516 (2006); &lt;em&gt;Henderson&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Shinseki&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/428"&gt;562 U. S. 428&lt;/a&gt;, 434–435 (2011).  A similar logic drives the clarity required here, when reading §2255(h) as the Government and the dissent do would “close our doors to a class of habeas petitioners.”  &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;, 540 U. S., at 381.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt; 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Section 2255(h)’s cross-reference does not provide the clear indication required to bar this Court’s review.  The language of the cross-reference is both narrow and specific.  It says that a second or successive §2255 motion “must be certified as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals to contain” one of two threshold content requirements.  (The text of the cross-reference does not end at “ ‘certified as provided in section 2244,’ ” as the dissent would have it.  See &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 5, 8, 10–11.)  The cross-reference thus appears to incorporate only the provisions in §2244 that “provid[e]” for how a “panel of the appropriate court of appeals” “certifie[s]” a second or successive filing and directs that those procedures be used to evaluate whether the filing “contain[s]” the content requirements listed in §2255(h).  Section 2244(b)(3)(E) is not one of those provisions, and it has nothing to do with the content requirements in §2255(h).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; First, the cross-reference speaks to how a “panel” of the court of appeals certifies a filing.  But this Court is not “a panel of the appropriate court of appeals,” §2255(h), so the cross-reference does not speak to this Court’s jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Second, this Court’s review (or lack thereof ) is not part of how a panel certifies a second or successive filing.  Section 2244(b)(3)(A) identifies that the filing must be certified in the court of appeals before an individual can proceed in the district court.  Section 2244(b)(3)(B) requires that a three-judge panel make the certification decision.  Section 2244(b)(3)(C) tells the panel that the filing must make a prima facie showing that it satisfies the relevant gatekeeping requirements.  Finally, §2244(b)(3)(D) instructs the panel to decide whether to certify a filing within 30 days of receiving the request.  These provisions all describe the  procedures that a panel must follow in certifying a second or successive filing, and are therefore incorporated by §2255(h)’s cross-reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In stark contrast, the certiorari bar in §2244(b)(3)(E) says nothing about how the §2255 motion must be certified.  It instead speaks to what happens after&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a panel has acted on a certification request: specifically, whether an individual can appeal the panel’s certification decision.  If the certiorari bar did not exist, no aspect of how the panel certifies a filing would change.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Put simply, “the certiorari bar addresses an entirely different act (filing a certiorari petition, not certifying a successive motion) by an entirely different actor (the prisoner, not the panel) in an entirely different court (this Court, not the court of appeals).”  Brief for Petitioner 33.  If Congress intended §2255(h) to incorporate this postcertification orange alongside all the panel-certification apples in §2244(b)(3), it did not say so clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Of course, as the Government and the dissent point out, barring appeals of certification decisions has an effect on the panel’s decision by making it conclusive.  Brief for United States 47; &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 9–10.  That effect, however, has little to do with how&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the “motion [is] certified . . . by a panel.”  §2255(h).  Section 2255(h)’s reference to how the “motion must be certified” under §2244 thus does not incorporate §2244(b)(3)(E)’s postcertification bar in the clear manner that &lt;em&gt;Castro &lt;/em&gt;requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Contrary to the dissent’s framing, &lt;em&gt;Hohn&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/524/236"&gt;524 U. S. 236 (1998)&lt;/a&gt;, does not support a different conclusion.  That case concerned whether the Court had jurisdiction over a decision by a three-judge panel to deny a prisoner a certificate of appealability under §2253(c), and held that the Court does have such jurisdiction.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 253.   Section 2253(c) applies to federal and state prisoners and dictates that, before an individual can appeal from a district court’s denial of a habeas petition, he must secure permission from “a circuit justice or judge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Court-appointed &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Hohn&lt;/em&gt; argued that the decision denying permission was not a “case” in the Court of Appeals for the purposes of this Court’s jurisdiction under §1254(1).  The Court rejected that construction, however, in part because it would have rendered §2244(b)(3)(E) (which the Court suggested was a requirement for “state prisoners filing second or successive habeas applications under §2254”) as superfluous.  See 524 U. S., at 249.  That was because all the reasons &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; gave for why a decision denying a certificate of appealability did not constitute a “case” for the purposes of §1254(1) would equally have applied to a decision denying authorization to bring a second or successive filing.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt; The Court nowhere held that §2244(b)(3)(E) applied to federal prisoners.  (That is not surprising because the case did not present that question.)  Nor does the Court’s holding today render §2244(b)(3)(E) superfluous: As all agree, it bars this Court’s review of panel authorization decisions concerning motions to file second or successive applications by state prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The dissent also relies on &lt;em&gt;Hohn&lt;/em&gt; to argue that it already stands for the proposition that §2244(B)(3)(E) imposes “a ‘clear limit’ on our jurisdiction” in this case.  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 7, 11–12; see also &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 15.  Not so.  No one disputes that the certiorari bar clearly deprives the Court of jurisdiction over classes of cases to which it applies.  See &lt;em&gt;Hohn&lt;/em&gt;, 524 U. S., at 250.  What is not clear is whether, through the cross-reference in §2255(h), Congress intended for that bar to extend to federal prisoners—a point &lt;em&gt;Hohn &lt;/em&gt;simply did not address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For these reasons, whether §2244(b)(3)(E)’s certiorari bar falls within the scope of §2255(h)’s cross-reference is at  most ambiguous.  Ambiguous language, however, cannot provide the required clear indication, and the Government’s and the dissent’s remaining arguments do not supply the necessary clarity that the text lacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; To begin, the Government contends that there is textual support in §2244(b)(3)(E) for the understanding that the certiorari bar applies to federal prisoners through the cross-reference.  On this score, the Government points to how §§2244(b)(3)(A)–(E) each use the term “second or successive application” instead of referring to §2254 specifically or state prisoners more generally.  This stands in contrast to nearly all the other provisions in §2244.  In the Government’s view, this textual variation means that Congress intended for §2255(h)’s cross-reference to incorporate any provision in §2244 that uses the term “second or successive application” and the breadth of the cross-reference therefore must be understood on those terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; If that were so, §2255(h)’s cross-reference would also in-corporate §2244(b)(4).  That provision directs district courts to review and “dismiss any claim presented in a second or successive application that the court of appeals has authorized . . . unless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies the requirements of ” §2244.  Put differently, once a second or successive application is certified, §2244(b)(4) tells a district court to doublecheck that the application satisfies §2244, including its gatekeeping requirements.  Section 2244(b)(4), however, plainly falls outside the scope of §2255(h)’s cross-reference because §2244(b)(4) has nothing to do with how a filing is “certified as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals.”  §2255(h).  Thus, accepting the Government’s argument that §2255(h)’s cross-reference should be understood to incorporate any provision in §2244 that uses “second or successive application” would essentially require interpreting §2255(h) to mean a federal prisoner’s second or successive motion “must conform to all provisions in section 2244 that  are not expressly limited to state prisoners.”  That, of course, is not what §2255(h) says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Government also points to part of §2244(b)(3)(E) that does speak to a “panel” of “a court of appeals.”  Specifically, §2244(b)(3)(E) says that an authorization decision “shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing,” thereby barring panel rehearing.  According to the Government, because §2244(b)(3)(E) speaks to the panel in some regard, §2255(h) must have intended to incorporate that provision in its entirety.  The Government is wrong, however, that the certiorari bar is incorporated in this way.  Whether §2244(b)(3)(E)’s panel-rehearing bar applies to federal prisoners says little, and certainly nothing clear, about whether Congress intended §2244(b)(3)(E)’s separate certiorari bar&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to extend to authorization decisions concerning federal prisoners.  Using the former to incorporate the latter is the kind of jurisdiction stripping by implication that cannot suffice.  Cf. &lt;em&gt;Felker&lt;/em&gt;, 518 U. S., at 660 (“Repeals [of jurisdiction] by implication are not favored”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Next, the Government and the dissent argue that allowing appeals from a panel’s certification decision to this Court is inconsistent with §2244(b)(3)(D).  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 20; Brief for United States 27–28.  That provision, which all agree is covered by §2255(h)’s cross-reference, imposes a 30-day clock on a panel’s certification decision after a litigant seeks authorization (though most Courts of Appeals view that requirement as advisory, see &lt;em&gt;In re Williams&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/898_F.3d_1098"&gt;898 F. 3d 1098&lt;/a&gt;, 1102, n. 5 (CA11 2018) (Wilson, J., specially concurring) (collecting cases); see also &lt;em&gt;infra&lt;/em&gt;, at 23–24, and n. 8).  When an individual seeks certiorari, on the other hand, he has 90 days from the date of decision to file a petition in this Court.  This Court’s Rule 13.1.  The Government suggests that the 30-day limit for panel review indicates that Congress wanted the certification decision to occur quickly, and that allowing prisoners to seek certiorari for an additional 90  days after the panel review concludes would thwart that intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Government’s argument is misguided.  Nothing about the Court’s decision today undermines §2244(b)(3)(D)’s timeline for the panel’s authorization decision.  Nor is this inference so compelling as to provide the needed clarity to cut off the Court’s jurisdiction: It is entirely plausible that Congress intended to require panels to move quickly, while still preserving the prisoner’s ability to seek further review in the rare case that warrants this Court’s attention.  See §2266 (placing time limits on the initial review of capital cases in the lower courts but placing no limits on this Court’s review).  Panels will still have the tools needed, moreover, to facilitate that quick review under the Court’s interpretation of §2255(h)’s cross-reference.  See &lt;em&gt;infra&lt;/em&gt;, at 23–24, and n. 8.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  From here, the Government resorts to another structural argument.  The certiorari bar is found in §2244(b)(3)’s fifth subparagraph.  Everyone agrees that §2255(h)’s cross- reference incorporates the preceding four subparagraphs.  The Government maintains that it would be odd that Congress intended to incorporate four of those subparagraphs and not all five.  Brief for United States 17, 23.  If Congress had intended for all five to travel together, however, it did not say so explicitly.  That would have been easy to do: Congress simply could have referenced §2244(b)(3) specifically, rather than broadly referencing §2244 with a narrow cross-reference only specifying how a second or successive filing is “certified” by a “panel.”  Congress did not.  The language  it used instead supports the understanding that the provisions the cross-reference incorporates turn on their substance, not where they sit in a list.  As explained, &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;, at 12–14, the certiorari bar does not clearly fall within the scope of the cross-reference on its own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Finally, the Government invokes a practical concern.  The Government suggests that it would make little sense to bar certiorari review of authorization decisions concerning state prisoners but not federal ones.  That argument carries little weight when the governing standard requires Congress to speak clearly.  It also misses the mark.  Congress treated state and federal prisoners differently across AEDPA, with state prisoners often facing far higher hurdles to relief.  To name a few examples: The statutory requirements for second or successive filings for federal and state prisoners are “not identical.”  &lt;em&gt;Gonzalez&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Crosby&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/545/524"&gt;545 U. S. 524&lt;/a&gt;, 529, n. 3 (2005); compare §§2244(b)(1)–(2) with §§2255(h)(1)–(2).  Indeed, the requirements for federal prisoners are more lenient, as explained in detail below.  See &lt;em&gt;infra&lt;/em&gt;, at 21–22.  Further, for state prisoners alone, Congress requires exhaustion, §§2254(b)–(c), and then, once in federal court, mandates deference to both the state court’s application of federal law and its factual determinations, §2254(d).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This differential treatment exists for good reason.  Congress enacted AEDPA “to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.”  &lt;em&gt;Williams&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Taylor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/529/362"&gt;529 U. S. 362&lt;/a&gt;, 436 (2000).  The Act “recognizes a foundational principle of our federal system: State courts are adequate forums for the vindication of federal rights.”  &lt;em&gt;Burt&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Titlow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/571/12"&gt;571 U. S. 12&lt;/a&gt;, 19 (2013).  Out of respect for state courts and their ability “to adjudicate claims of constitutional wrong, AEDPA erect[ed] a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief for [state] prisoners.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.  &lt;/em&gt;Federal courts “will not lightly conclude that a State’s criminal justice system has experienced the ‘extreme malfunctio[n]’ for which federal habeas relief  is the remedy.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 20; see also &lt;em&gt;Greene&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Fisher&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/565/34"&gt;565 U. S. 34&lt;/a&gt;, 38 (2011) (observing that “the purpose of AEDPA is to ensure that federal habeas” review of state-court proceedings does not function as a “means of error correction”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Comity and federalism, however, fall away when a federal court reviews a federal judgment.  By the time a federal prisoner looks to file a second or successive motion, moreover, he will have had fewer bites at the apple, and fewer courts reviewing his case, than most state prisoners in the same position.  See §2254(b)(1)(A); &lt;em&gt;In re Graham&lt;/em&gt;, 61 F. 4th 433, 441 (CA4 2023).  Although the Federal Government has an interest in finality too, &lt;em&gt;Mayle&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Felix&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/545/644"&gt;545 U. S. 644&lt;/a&gt;, 662 (2005), “ ‘[n]o legislation pursues its purposes at all costs,’ ” &lt;em&gt;Mohamad&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/566/449"&gt;566 U. S. 449&lt;/a&gt;, 460 (2012).  Allowing further review in this Court is thus consistent with both AEDPA’s purposes and practical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; At bottom, the Government’s arguments suggest that §2255(h)’s cross-reference might include §2244(b)(3)(E)’s certiorari bar.  They do not, however, provide the necessary “clear indication” that Congress intended to “close our doors to a class of habeas petitioners seeking review.”  &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;, 540 U. S., at 381.  Absent such clear indication, federal prisoners are not prohibited from seeking certiorari from a panel’s denial of authorization to file a second or successive motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;III&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Turning now to the merits upon which the Court granted certiorari, Bowe and the Government agree that the Eleventh Circuit erred by applying §2244(b)(1) to Bowe’s request for authorization to file a second or successive motion to vacate under §2255(h).  The Court appointed Kasdin M. Mitchell as &lt;em&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/em&gt; to argue in support of the Eleventh Circuit’s position.  604 U. S. ___ (2025).  She has ably discharged her responsibilities.  The Court nevertheless agrees with the parties and holds that §2244(b)(1) does not  apply to motions filed by federal prisoners under §2255(h).  The contrary decision of the Eleventh Circuit is reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Begin with the text.  Section 2244(b)(1) states that “[a] claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.”  State prisoners alone file habeas corpus applications under §2254.  See §2254(a) (noting that §2254 is limited to “a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court”); see also &lt;em&gt;Magwood&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Patterson&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/561/320"&gt;561 U. S. 320&lt;/a&gt;, 333 (2010) (“The requirement of custody &lt;em&gt;pursuant to a state court-judgment&lt;/em&gt; distinguishes §2254 from other statutory provisions authorizing relief from constitutional violations—such as §2255, which allows challenges to the judgments of federal courts”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This specific reference to §2254 was deliberate: Elsewhere in this very section, §2244 acknowledges §2255.  See §2244(a) (referencing §2255); see also §§2253(c)(1)(A)–(B) (distinguishing a “final order” in a “habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court” from one “in a proceeding under section 2255”); §2266(a) (distinguishing an “application under section 2254” from a “motion under section 2255”).  A cardinal rule of statutory interpretation teaches that “when we’re engaged in the business of interpreting statutes[,] we presume differences in language like this convey differences in meaning.”  &lt;em&gt;Henson&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Santander Consumer USA Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/582/79"&gt;582 U. S. 79&lt;/a&gt;, 86 (2017).  Thus, by its plain terms, §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar applies only to state prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Nor does §2255(h)’s cross-reference to §2244 otherwise make §2244(b)(1) applicable to second or successive motions filed by federal prisoners.  &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt;, as well as the dissent, however, argues that it does.  As they see it, §2255(h) incorporates §2244, including §2244(b)(3)(C).  Section 2244(b)(3)(C), in turn, requires a panel to determine that  “the application makes a prima facie showing that [it] satisfies the requirements of this subsection.”  From here, one of the “requirements of . . . subsection” (b) is §2244(b)(1).  Following this chain of cross-references where it leads, &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; and the dissent say, §2244(b)(1) must apply to federal prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The reasoning why this Court has jurisdiction also shows the error in&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this position.  See&lt;em&gt; supra&lt;/em&gt;, at 12–14.  Section 2255(h)’s cross-reference incorporates the procedures in §2244 only as they relate to how a panel certifies a second or successive filing.  It then tells the panel to use those procedures to evaluate whether the federal prisoner’s second or successive motion “contain[s]” either newly discovered evidence, §2255(h)(1), or a new rule of constitutional law, §2255(h)(2).  Nothing in §2255(h) suggests that it incorporates §2244 for any other purposes.  Thus, by its terms, §2255(h)’s cross-reference does not incorporate the content requirements contained in §2244, like §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt; and the dissent’s broad reading of §2244(b)(3)(C) would also put §2255 on a collision course with §2244.  Section 2244(b) imposes two limitations on the content of a second or successive habeas application: §2244(b)(1), which bars old claims; and §2244(b)(2), which prescribes “two grounds” in which a claim “not previously raised” can proceed in a “second or successive application.”  &lt;em&gt;Burton&lt;/em&gt;, 549 U. S., at 153.  Section 2244(b)(3)(C), on which &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; relies, requires individuals to satisfy all the “requirements of this subsection,” including both §§2244(b)(1) and (b)(2).  The upshot of &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt;’s argument would therefore be that §2255(h) incorporates not only §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar, but also §2244(b)(2)’s substantive gatekeeping requirements for new claims.  Section 2255(h), however, contains its own substantive requirements that are irreconcilable with those in §2244(b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  In particular, §2255(h)(1) permits a second or successive §2255 motion if the petitioner identifies “newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense.”  Section 2244(b)(2)(B) also concerns claims based on new facts, but it is more limited than §2255’s in two ways.  First, it confines the new-facts exception to scenarios in which the new facts “could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence.”  §2244(b)(2)(B)(i).  Second, it requires that the movant show “by clear and convincing evidence that, &lt;em&gt;but for constitutional error&lt;/em&gt;, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.”  §2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; If Congress had incorporated §2244(b)(2)(B)’s more stringent exception into §2255(h), then §2255(h)(1)’s more lenient exception would become a dead letter.  Because “ ‘Congress presumably does not enact useless laws,’ ” &lt;em&gt;Garland &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Cargill&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/406"&gt;602 U. S. 406&lt;/a&gt;, 427 (2024), it makes no sense to read §2255(h)’s cross-reference in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Recognizing the problem with this position, &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; and the dissent attempt to limit the scope of “requirements of this subsection” in §2244(B)(3)(C) to capture only those content requirements in §§2244(b)(1) and (b)(2) that do not conflict with §2255(h).  In their view, Congress intended for the substantive gatekeeping requirements in §2244(b) to apply to federal prisoners by default, unless they deviated from those requirements in §2255(h).  To &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt;, the new-facts exception illustrates this approach.  This argument, however, is undercut by the fact that in §2244(b)(2)(A) and §2255(h)(2), Congress repeated verbatim the standard for when a second or successive filing can proceed based on a new, retroactive rule of constitutional law.  If §2244(b)(2)(A) already provided the default rule, there would have been no need for Congress to repeat it in §2255(h)(2), rendering its  inclusion mere surplusage.  &lt;em&gt;Hohn&lt;/em&gt;, 524 U. S., at 249 (declining “to adopt a construction making another statutory provision superfluous”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; At bottom, the best textual reading of both §2255(h) and §2244(b) is that, when a federal prisoner moves for authorization, a panel can authorize the filing if it satisfies one of the two grounds in §2255(h), the “two—and only two—conditions in which a second or successive §2255 motion may proceed.”  &lt;em&gt;Jones&lt;/em&gt;, 599 U. S., at 477.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt;’s remaining nontextual arguments do not change this conclusion.  She contends that §2244(b)(1) is a necessary tool, indeed “central,” for panels to meet §2244(b)(3)(D)’s 30-day deadline, and that Congress therefore must have intended for it to apply in all cases in which authorization is needed.  Brief for Court-Appointed &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Curiae&lt;/em&gt; 12, 23–26.  That logical leap lacks sufficient foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For one, it is not clear why searching through case files to see if the litigant has raised a claim before is any easier than determining whether the litigant has identified new evidence or a new rule of constitutional law that is retroactive.  As the parties explain, it seems just as likely that the panel’s obligation to assess only whether a filing has made a prima facie&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;showing that it satisfies §2255(h)’s content requirements, and not to undertake a more searching inquiry on the merits, is what facilitates the 30-day deadline.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 9–10; Reply Brief for United States 9; see also &lt;em&gt;Tyler&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Cain&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/533/656"&gt;533 U. S. 656&lt;/a&gt;, 664, 661, n. 3 (2001).  &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt; certainly provides no evidence to suggest that her hypothesis is the more plausible one.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Regardless, &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt;’s “speculation as to Congress’ intent” in enacting the old-claim bar and 30-day deadline “cannot replace the actual text” Congress enacted.  &lt;em&gt;Magwood&lt;/em&gt;, 561 U. S., at 334.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt; further argues that Congress meant for AEDPA to treat second or successive filings by federal and state prisoners the same.  As already explained, however, AEDPA is replete with examples of Congress treating state and federal prisoners differently—including in the context of limitations on second or successive filings.  &lt;em&gt;Supra&lt;/em&gt;, at 18–19.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Some courts, including the Eleventh Circuit below, have relied on this policy justification and others like it in applying §2244(b)(1) to bar second or successive motions filed by federal prisoners under §2255(h).  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;In re&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Baptiste&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/828_F.3d_1337"&gt;828 F. 3d 1337&lt;/a&gt;, 1339 (2016) (“[I]t would be odd indeed if Congress had intended to allow federal prisoners to refile precisely the same non-meritorious motions over and over again while denying that right to state prisoners”).  Those courts erred: “[P]urposive argument simply cannot overcome the force of the plain text.”  &lt;em&gt;Mohamad&lt;/em&gt;, 566 U. S., at 460.  Any concern associated with Congress allowing old-claim repeat litigation for federal prisoners, moreover, is  overstated: All claims, even the repeat ones, must meet the “strictly limited” threshold requirements of §2255(h), &lt;em&gt;Jones&lt;/em&gt;, 599 U. S., at 476, and should they survive that review, they must still conform with the demanding statute of limitations contained in §2255(f ), &lt;em&gt;Dodd&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/545/353"&gt;545 U. S. 353&lt;/a&gt;, 359 (2005).  Very few claims will satisfy either, let alone both.  Ultimately, there is “no reason to doubt” that “Congress said what it meant and meant what it said” in §2244(b)(1) and §2255(h).  &lt;em&gt;Loughrin&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/573/351"&gt;573 U. S. 351&lt;/a&gt;, 360 (2014).&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For these reasons, §2244(b)(1) does not apply to second or successive motions filed by federal prisoners challenging their convictions or sentences under §2255(h).  The Court leaves it to the Eleventh Circuit to determine in the first instance whether Bowe should receive authorization to file a second or successive motion under the correct standard.  The judgment below is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-2ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  Compare &lt;em&gt;Winarske&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/913_F.3d_765"&gt;913 F. 3d 765&lt;/a&gt; (CA8 2019); &lt;em&gt;In re Bourgeois&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/902_F.3d_446"&gt;902 F. 3d 446&lt;/a&gt; (CA5 2018); &lt;em&gt;In re Baptiste&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/828_F.3d_1337"&gt;828 F. 3d 1337&lt;/a&gt; (CA11 2016); &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Winkelman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/746_F.3d_134"&gt;746 F. 3d 134&lt;/a&gt; (CA3 2014); &lt;em&gt;Gallagher&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/711_F.3d_315"&gt;711 F. 3d 315&lt;/a&gt; (CA2 2013) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;); and &lt;em&gt;Brannigan&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/249_F.3d_584"&gt;249 F. 3d 584&lt;/a&gt; (CA7 2001), with &lt;em&gt;In re Graham&lt;/em&gt;, 61 F. 4th 433 (CA4 2023); &lt;em&gt;Jones&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, 36 F. 4th 974 (CA9 2022); and &lt;em&gt;Williams&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/927_F.3d_427"&gt;927 F. 3d 427&lt;/a&gt; (CA6 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2244#b_1"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2244(b)(1)&lt;/a&gt; (“[a] claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254”); §2244(b)(2) (same); §2244(c) (“[i]n a habeas corpus proceeding brought in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court”); §2244(d)(1) (“application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court”); see also §2244(d)(2) (“application for State post-conviction or other collateral review”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-4ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;  The Government stresses, and the dissent echoes, that the &lt;em&gt;Castro &lt;/em&gt;Court “took as a given” that §2244(b)(3)(E) applies to federal prisoners by concluding that it had jurisdiction because the subject of the certiorari petition fell outside of the provision’s scope, not because the provision applied to state prisoners alone.  Brief for United States 18, 30–31.  As the Government elsewhere acknowledges, however, the Court did not address the threshold question whether §2244(b)(3)(E) applies to federal prisoners.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 31 (observing that &lt;em&gt;Castro &lt;/em&gt;“did not even comment on the issue”).  Thus, at most, the Court assumed for the sake of its analysis that §2244(b)(3)(E) applied.  That assumption is not a holding to which the Court is now bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-5ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;  The dissent’s rendition of &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; is mistaken.  It suggests&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the clear-indication requirement was tied to the “troublesome resul[t]” that, under the Government’s interpretation, a prisoner could not appeal a panel decision characterizing a filing as his first, not his second, even though the Court had previously allowed the Government to appeal a decision reaching the opposite result.  See &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;, 540 U. S., at 380; &lt;em&gt;Stewart&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Martinez-Villareal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/523/637"&gt;523 U. S. 637&lt;/a&gt;, 641–642 (1998); see also &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 6–7, 14–15 (opinion of &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt;, J.).  That was one troubling result of the Government’s position, but &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; also listed two more troubling results: the “clos[ing of] our doors to a class of habeas petitioners seeking review without any clear indication that such was Congress’ intent,” and the difficulty in “reconcil[ing]” that outcome “with the basic principle that we ‘read limitations on our jurisdiction to review narrowly.’ ”  540 U. S., at 380–381.  The latter two concerns arise here, and thus &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; requires a clear indication before we will “close our doors” to this distinct class of prisoners seeking habeas relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-6ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  No one contends that &lt;em&gt;Boechler&lt;/em&gt; controls this case.  But see &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 13–14.  The &lt;em&gt;Boechler&lt;/em&gt; line of cases simply demonstrates that this Court requires clarity in some contexts even absent constitutional concerns, undermining any suggestion that constitutional avoidance is the only permissible source of &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;’s rule or other interpretative rules like it.  Nor does this line of cases stand alone.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Morrison&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;National Australia Bank Ltd.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/561/247"&gt;561 U. S. 247&lt;/a&gt;, 255 (2010) (describing the presumption against extraterritoriality, which requires a “clear indication of an extraterritorial application” for a statute to reach beyond domestic affairs, as reflecting “a canon of construction, . . . rather than a limit upon Congress’s power to legislate”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-7ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;  The dissent asks “[w]hat would be the point” of subparagraph (B) without the certiorari bar in subparagraph (E).  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 9.  The point of (B) is still apparent.  It identifies who makes the authorization determination in the first instance: a “three-judge panel of the court of appeals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-8ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;  Nor does the Court’s decision today risk unduly opening the floodgates to frivolous appeals from authorization decisions concerning federal prisoners.  Such appeals will be governed by the ordinary rules that prevent abuses of the Court’s certiorari docket in every other circumstance.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., this Court’s Rules 39.8, 42.2.  If Congress thought it best to strip the Court of jurisdiction to keep these appeals away from the Court’s docket nonetheless, it failed to convey that intent sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-9ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;  For support, &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; relies on the fact that the three Circuits that do not apply §2244(b)(1) to federal prisoners do not consider the 30-day deadline binding, suggesting that the failure to apply §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar is the reason for their failure to comply with the 30-day deadline in all cases.  Brief for Court-Appointed &lt;em&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/em&gt; 24–25.  &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt; overlooks, however, that three out of the six Circuits that apply §2244(b)(1) to federal prisoners also do not treat that deadline as binding.  Compare &lt;em&gt;In re Williams&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/898_F.3d_1098"&gt;898 F. 3d 1098&lt;/a&gt;, 1102, n. 5 (CA11 2018) (Wilson, J., specially concurring) (noting that the Second, Third, and Seventh Circuits do not treat the 30-day deadline as binding, and that the Eighth Circuit has not yet “opined on the issue”), with &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;, at&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;5, n. 1 (collecting those Circuits on the side of the Circuit split applying §2244(b)(1) to federal prisoners).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-10ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;  This is not the only way in which Congress has treated old claims filed by federal and state prisoners differently.  Section 2244(c) bars state prisoners from raising a claim or challenging facts in the federal postconviction setting that were adjudicated by this Court on direct review.  This bar does not apply to federal prisoners, even though this Court can also exercise jurisdiction over appeals on direct review of federal convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-11ref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;  Although the common law did not apply traditional res judicata principles to habeas petitions, courts developed different equitable doctrines to address abuses of the writ.  See &lt;em&gt;McCleskey&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Zant&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/499/467"&gt;499 U. S. 467&lt;/a&gt;, 479–489 (1991).  Congress can displace those doctrines, but in the absence of evidence of that intent, federal courts can continue to use those common-law tools.  Cf. &lt;em&gt;Banister&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/590/504"&gt;590 U. S. 504&lt;/a&gt;, 515 (2020) (concluding that AEDPA did not displace the historical practice of applying &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_59#rule_59_e) "&gt;Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) &lt;/a&gt;in habeas).  Section 2244(b) codified a “modified res judicata rule” for second or successive petitions.  &lt;em&gt;Felker&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Turpin&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/518/651"&gt;518 U. S. 651&lt;/a&gt;, 664 (1996).  As the Government argues here, AEDPA may not have displaced other practices that courts can still use to address repetitive filings made by federal prisoners in the absence of §2244(b)(1).  See Brief for United States 48–50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div&gt;[January 9, 2026]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt;, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I agree with the Court that, under our precedents, Congress was required to say more if it wanted &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2244#b_3_E"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2244(b)(3)(E)&lt;/a&gt; to strip our jurisdiction over federal prisoners’ requests for review of panel-certification decisions.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 10.  I likewise agree with the Court’s conclusion that §2244(b)(1)’s bar on do-over claims in second or successive applications applies only to state prisoners.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 20–21.  I write separately to offer my view of what Congress likely sought to accomplish with §2244(b)(3)(E): insulating a three-judge panel’s properly made (even if erroneous) gatekeeping determination from further review.  The provision’s language, our decision in &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/540/375"&gt;540 U. S. 375&lt;/a&gt;, 381 (2003), and the broader statute’s detailed gatekeeping scheme all support this interpretation.  Because the three-judge panel here did not deny Bowe’s petition pursuant to the statutorily prescribed procedures, I think it did not make the sort of determination Congress intended to insulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Section 2244(b)(3)(E) provides that “[t]he grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.”  This provision thus prevents our Court from  reviewing a certiorari petition whose “subject” is the “grant” or “denial” of a request for “authorization . . . to file a second or successive application.”  That proscription does not cover Bowe’s petition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In its decision below, the Court of Appeals did not grant or deny Bowe authorization to proceed on his successive claim.  Rather, it&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“dismissed” his proposed claim “for lack of jurisdiction.”  &lt;em&gt;In re Bowe&lt;/em&gt;, Civ. No. 24–11704 (CA11, June 27, 2024), App. 79.  True, “the label attached to an order” does not erase its “practical effect.”  &lt;em&gt;Abbott&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Perez&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/579"&gt;585 U. S. 579&lt;/a&gt;, 594 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 17, n. 4 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch, J., &lt;/span&gt;dissenting).  But, in this case, the distinction between a denial and a dismissal is practical, not semantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As I read §2244(b)(3)(E), a “grant or denial” occurs when a three-judge panel goes through the screening procedures Congress has prescribed and applies the appropriate criteria for second or successive claims.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Here, the three-judge panel never actually applied the relevant criteria to Bowe’s motion—that is, the criteria for federal prisoners under §§2255(h)(1) and (h)(2).  Instead, the panel reflexively dismissed Bowe’s authorization request, holding that §2244(b)(1)’s bar on do-over claims deprived it of jurisdiction, even though §2244(b)(1) applies only to state prisoners, for the reasons the Court explains.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As a result, a three-judge panel never undertook the required process for evaluating—&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;., for granting or denying—Bowe’s authorization request.  Put differently,  because the panel &lt;em&gt;dismissed&lt;/em&gt; Bowe’s petition, there was no “grant or denial” of his “authorization” request that could be challenged in a petition for certiorari, as §2244(b)(3)(E) requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This reading of §2244(b)(3)(E) finds support in &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;.  That case, like this one, came to us in a distinct posture.  Castro, a federal prisoner, filed a motion in the District Court to vacate his sentence under §2255.  See 540 U. S., at 378.  Because Castro did not understand his motion to be second or successive, he did not first seek authorization from a three-judge panel in the Court of Appeals.  See &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 378–379; see also &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2244#b_3_A"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2244(b)(3)(A)&lt;/a&gt; (“Before a second or successive application . . . is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application”).  Taking a different view than Castro, the District Court “dismissed the motion for failure to comply with” the statutory restrictions on second or successive claims.  540 U. S., at 379.  On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the District Court’s analysis and affirmed without evaluating Castro’s motion on the merits.  Castro subsequently filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, seeking to challenge the Eleventh Circuit’s second or successive determination.  But the Government contended that we lacked jurisdiction under §2244(b)(3)(E).  See &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 379–380.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We ultimately held that §2244(b)(3)(E) did not bar our review of Castro’s petition.  In so holding, we emphasized that Castro had not “asked the Court of Appeals to grant, and it nowhere denied, any ‘authorization . . . to file a second or successive application.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 380 (quoting §2244(b)(3)(E)).  Instead, the case came to the Eleventh Circuit on appeal, after the District Court had already made its own determination about the viability of Castro’s motion.  In that posture, we explained, the Eleventh Circuit had not made a “statutorily relevant ‘denial’ of a request”  for authorization—even though the court’s conclusion “had the &lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt; of denying ‘authorization’ ” to Castro.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 380.  Against that procedural background, the “ ‘subject’ ” of Castro’s certiorari petition was “not the Court of Appeals’ ‘denial of an authorization,’ ” so we retained our jurisdiction despite §2244(b)(3)(E).  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; So too here.  To be sure, unlike &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;, Bowe’s case has moved through the initial procedure for second or successive motions—that is, Bowe comes to us after first requesting authorization from a three-judge panel in the Court of Appeals.  But, just like &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;, the three-judge panel never made a “statutorily relevant” denial of Bowe’s authorization request.  To do so, the panel would have had to go through the applicable statutory criteria and determine whether Bowe’s successive motion satisfied the conditions of §§2255(h)(1) and (h)(2).  Because the panel never made such a determination, it neither granted nor denied Bowe’s authorization request, as required to bar our review under §2244(b)(3)(E).&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt; II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; One might reasonably question why Congress would have crafted §2244(b)(3)(E) to achieve such a technical distinction: barring further review of denials on the merits while permitting further review of the panel’s use of the wrong criteria or procedures.  As &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt; points out, the effect is the same; either way, the prisoner may not file his second or successive motion.  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 17, n. 4.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But in my view, the distinction is not a technical (or meaningless) one.  Instead, it fits neatly within, and advances, the gatekeeping scheme Congress established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For evidence, look no further than §2244(b)(3)’s other subparagraphs, which set forth a multipart gatekeeping process for second or successive claims.  First, a prisoner “move[s] in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing” a second or successive claim.  §2244(b)(3)(A).  Second, “a three-judge panel” considers the request for authorization.  §2244(b)(3)(B).  Third, the panel “determines” whether the prisoner has made “a prima facie showing” of satisfying the relevant statutory “requirements.”  §2244(b)(3)(C).  Fourth, the panel issues its determination in no more than “30 days.”  §2244(b)(3)(D).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; With §2244(b)(3), Congress plainly erected a specific screening process for second or successive petitions.  And with subparagraph (E), in particular, Congress afforded that process finality—but only if the prescribed procedures have been properly followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; By contrast, consider a panel that completely ignores the statute’s specified gatekeeping requirements when making the authorization determination.  Maybe the panel consists of five judges instead of three.  Or maybe the panel automatically and arbitrarily denies all requests for authorization, refusing to evaluate whether the prisoner has satisfied the relevant statutory criteria.  It would be exceedingly strange for us to conclude that Congress meant to insulate a rogue panel’s actions from further review.  Indeed, why  would Congress devise such a detailed gatekeeping scheme while foreclosing review of its evasion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; At bottom, then, §2244(b)(3)(E) rationally operates as a finality provision, designed to give a three-judge panel the last say when the panel properly performs its gatekeeping function.  But when the panel goes through the wrong procedures (as it did in &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;) or applies the wrong criteria (as it did here), it has not made the requisite “grant or denial of an authorization” that §2244(b)(3)(E) insulates from further review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For that reason, in my view, even if Congress had spoken more clearly about §2244(b)(3)(E)’s application to federal prisoners, the panel’s mistaken dismissal—instead of denial—of Bowe’s petition makes §2244(b)(3)(E) patently inapplicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-2ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  Today’s dispute encompasses a disagreement about which set of statutory criteria applies to &lt;em&gt;federal&lt;/em&gt; prisoners: §2244(b)(1) or §2255(h).  According to &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt;, “[e]veryone agrees” that §2244(b)(3)(E) “precludes us from exercising certiorari jurisdiction to review an appellate panel’s decision granting or denying certification to &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; prisoners.”  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 3 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis added).  I agree with that assertion, but, as I will explain, only insofar as it refers to appellate-panel decisions that actually apply the statutory criteria and specified procedures for granting or denying state prisoners’ authorization requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  Because &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;’s analysis calls for a “statutorily relevant” denial, 540 U. S., at 380, it lays bare &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Gorsuch’&lt;/span&gt;s mistaken contention that “[a] denial is a denial” for §2244(b)(3)(E) purposes, &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 17, n. 4.  Reading the statute as I do also resolves the purported tension in the Court’s opinion that &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt; elsewhere identifies: Why would the Court “take the trouble to show” that Castro, a federal prisoner, “wasn’t pursuing a second or successive attack subject to subparagraph (E)” if that provision had “no bearing whatsoever on federal prisoners in the first place?”  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 7.  The answer, of course, is that the Court had no need to resolve subparagraph (E)’s application to all federal prisoners when the provision so clearly did not apply to Castro.  In other words, the Court left open the question whether subparagraph (E) prevented our review of a certiorari petition whose “ ‘subject’ ” actually is a “statutorily relevant ‘denial’ of a request” for authorization to file a successive claim under &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2255"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2255&lt;/a&gt;.  540 U. S., at 380.  I agree with today’s conclusion that subparagraph (E) does not prevent our review under those circumstances.

&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[January 9, 2026]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt;, with whom &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Thomas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Alito&lt;/span&gt; join, and with whom &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Barrett&lt;/span&gt; joins as to Part I, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), courts of appeals serve an important gatekeeping function.  When a state prisoner seeks to challenge his conviction or sentence in federal court for the first time, he normally proceeds directly to district court under &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2254"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2254&lt;/a&gt;.  But before a state prisoner may bring a second or successive attack in district court, AEDPA requires him to obtain a certificate from a panel of the relevant federal court of appeals.  And under §2244, an appellate panel may certify a case to proceed only subject to certain demanding rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Two are relevant here.  First, an appellate panel may not authorize do-over claims—claims the prisoner already “presented in a prior” federal challenge.  §2244(b)(1).  Second, neither a state prisoner nor state authorities may file a petition for rehearing or seek “a writ of certiorari” to contest an appellate panel’s decision granting or denying certification.  §2244(b)(3)(E).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; AEDPA contains parallel directions for federal prisoners.  When a federal prisoner seeks to challenge his conviction or sentence collaterally for the first time, he usually proceeds directly to district court under §2255.  But before he can pursue a second or successive challenge, it “must be  certified as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals.”  §2255(h).  Through that cross-reference, then, federal prisoners seeking to bring second or successive collateral attacks are generally subject to the same rules as their state counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; That brings us to Michael Bowe.  After shooting two guards while trying to rob an armored vehicle in 2008, he pleaded guilty to three federal crimes.  Since then, he has pursued five nearly identical postconviction challenges.  In each, Mr. Bowe has asserted that one of the statutes under which he was convicted, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924#c"&gt;18 U. S. C. §924(c)&lt;/a&gt;, is unconstitutional under our void-for-vagueness doctrine.  And in all but the first of his challenges, Mr. Bowe has centered his argument around the same case: &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/445"&gt;588 U. S. 445 (2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; When Mr. Bowe sought permission to bring his latest collateral attack, the Eleventh Circuit demurred.  Because he had pursued his &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt; claim three times before, the court held that his latest filing represented an impermissible do-over claim barred by §2244(b)(1).  Now, Mr. Bowe asks us to reverse the Eleventh Circuit’s decision.  Yes, he concedes, AEDPA bars state prisoners from pursuing do-over claims.  But, he insists, federal prisoners are different.  They (and they alone) are free to bring the same claim in district court over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Before we can take up that question, however, we must answer another.  Under §2244(b)(3)(E), Mr. Bowe acknowledges, this Court lacks certiorari jurisdiction to review an appellate panel’s decision denying a state prisoner leave to file a second or successive collateral challenge.  But here again, Mr. Bowe argues federal prisoners are different.  He submits that they (and, once more, they alone) are free to challenge adverse certification decisions on writ of certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  Because I do not believe that either of Mr. Bowe’s pleas for federal-prisoner exceptionalism can be squared with AEDPA’s text, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I understand my colleagues’ eagerness to reach the merits of this case.  As they observe, the courts of appeals are divided on the question whether federal prisoners like Mr. Bowe may pursue do-over claims.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 5.  Doubtless, too, it is often this Court’s job to resolve circuit splits and bring nationwide uniformity to the application of federal law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; But it is also one of our paramount responsibilities to respect the limits on our jurisdiction.  And, to my eyes, AEDPA precludes us from exercising certiorari jurisdiction here.  Section 2244 instructs that “the grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive” collateral attack “shall not be the subject of a petition . . . for a writ of certiorari.”  §2244(b)(3)(E).  Everyone agrees this provision precludes us from exercising certiorari jurisdiction to review an appellate panel’s decision granting or denying certification to state prisoners.  And because §2255(h) tells us that the same rules apply to federal prisoners, exactly the same outcome follows for federal prisoners like Mr. Bowe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Importantly, though, that does not mean we lack for ways to resolve the circuit split my colleagues worry over.  AEDPA may prevent us from exercising certiorari jurisdiction under §1254(1).  But AEDPA not only leaves untouched our power to entertain original habeas petitions filed directly in this Court.  &lt;em&gt;Felker&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Turpin&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/518/651"&gt;518 U. S. 651&lt;/a&gt;, 660–661 (1996).  AEDPA also leaves untouched our power to accept certified “question[s] of law” from the federal courts of appeals and provide them with “binding instructions” on how to answer those questions under §1254(2), a provision  found right next door to the one governing our certiorari jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Accustomed as we are to proceeding by way of certiorari under §1254(1), it’s true that we have rarely accepted certified questions under §1254(2).  But a rare procedure befits rare circumstances.  And this case involves a rare circumstance indeed—a circuit split that would otherwise stagger on forever.  Rather than ignore §2244’s express constraint on our certiorari jurisdiction, then, we might have simply signaled to the courts of appeals our willingness to accept certification in this or a similar case.  Cf. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Rice&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/327/742"&gt;327 U. S. 742&lt;/a&gt;, 746–747 (1946) (accepting certification in the uncommon situation of a “circuit court of appeals . . . equally divided on” questions of law).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; To appreciate why we lack certiorari jurisdiction, it helps to start with a bird’s eye view of how AEDPA addresses second or successive collateral attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; AEDPA seeks “to advance the finality of criminal convictions.”  &lt;em&gt;Mayle&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Felix&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/545/644"&gt;545 U. S. 644&lt;/a&gt;, 662 (2005).  It does so, in part, by imposing “stric[t] limit[s]” on the ability of federal and state prisoners to bring multiple postconviction attacks in federal court.  See &lt;em&gt;Jones&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hendrix&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/465"&gt;599 U. S. 465&lt;/a&gt;, 476 (2023).  So, for example, a federal prisoner’s second or successive collateral attack “must be certified . . . to contain” a showing of either new facts or new law.  §2255(h).  The new-facts route requires the prisoner to show that he possesses newly discovered evidence that, if proved, would establish his innocence clearly and convincingly.  See §2255(h)(1).  The new-law route requires him to argue that his conviction or sentence is unlawful in light of a new rule of constitutional law that this Court has made retroactively  applicable to cases on collateral review.  See §2255(h)(2).  Similar rules apply to state prisoners under §2244(b)(2).&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Even beyond those constraints, AEDPA imposes others.  A federal prisoner’s second or successive §2255 attack not only must “contain” either new facts or new law; it also “must be certified as provided in section 2244.”  §2255(h).  Everyone agrees this cross-reference directs us to §2244(b)(3).  That paragraph provides these instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “(A)  Before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “(B)  A motion in the court of appeals . . . shall be determined by a three-judge panel of the court of appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “(C)  The court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of this subsection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “(D)  The court of appeals shall grant or deny the authorization . . . not later than 30 days after the filing of the motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “(E)  The grant or denial of an authorization . . . shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; With this overview in hand, our lack of certiorari jurisdiction quickly becomes clear.  Section 2244(b)(3)(E) prohibits a state prisoner from invoking our certiorari jurisdiction to challenge an order denying him leave to file a second or successive collateral attack.  Indeed, this Court has already held as much.  &lt;em&gt;Felker&lt;/em&gt;, 518 U. S., at 658–659.  And §2255(h)  tells us that a federal prisoner seeking to pursue a second or successive collateral attack must obtain certification “as provided in section 2244” for state prisoners.  Accordingly, the same bar on certiorari applies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; That commonsense conclusion finds unanimous support in the courts of appeals.  Just as §2244(b)(3)(E) bars certiorari petitions, it also bars petitions for panel or en banc rehearing.  Since AEDPA’s adoption in 1996, a great many federal prisoners have sought rehearing on the theory that this rule applies only to state prisoners, not them.  Yet every circuit to consider that approach has rejected it, recognizing instead that subparagraph (E) applies to federal prisoners no less than their state counterparts, and thus prohibits them from petitioning for panel or en banc rehearing.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;In re Clark&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/837_F.3d_1080"&gt;837 F. 3d 1080&lt;/a&gt;, 1082–1083 (CA10 2016) (collecting cases); &lt;em&gt;In re Baptiste&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/828_F.3d_1337"&gt;828 F. 3d 1337&lt;/a&gt;, 1340 (CA11 2016); &lt;em&gt;Págan-San Miguel &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/736_F.3d_44"&gt;736 F. 3d 44&lt;/a&gt;, 46, n. 1 (CA1 2013) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;); &lt;em&gt;In re Sonshine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/132_F.3d_1133"&gt;132 F. 3d 1133&lt;/a&gt;, 1134 (CA6 1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Our own precedent carries the same message.  In &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/540/375"&gt;540 U. S. 375 (2003)&lt;/a&gt;, the government argued that subparagraph (E) precluded this Court from considering a federal prisoner’s challenge to an appellate panel decision &lt;em&gt;denying&lt;/em&gt; him leave to file a second or successive attack.  At the same time, the government contended, the terms of subparagraph (E) leave it free to challenge many appellate panel decisions &lt;em&gt;granting &lt;/em&gt;a federal prisoner permission to proceed.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 380–381.  The Court rejected both submissions.  First, after conducting a painstakingly detailed analysis of the filing history of the particular prisoner before it, the Court concluded that his challenge was not in fact second or successive.  So subparagraph (E)—which applies only to second or successive challenges—simply was not implicated in the case at hand.  See &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 379–380.  Second, the Court rejected the government’s “anomal[ou]s” suggestion that subparagraph (E) might  allow it, but not a prisoner, to challenge an adverse appellate panel decision regarding a second or successive filing.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 380–381.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Neither holding makes sense unless subparagraph (E) applies to federal prisoners pursuing second or successive collateral attacks.  Why take the trouble to show &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; federal prisoner wasn’t pursuing a second or successive attack subject to subparagraph (E)—and why bother rejecting the government’s lopsided argument about how subparagraph (E) works—if subparagraph (E) has no bearing whatsoever on federal prisoners in the first place?  While &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; may not have announced a “holding” that subparagraph (E) applies to federal prisoners pursuing second or successive collateral attacks, &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 9, n. 3, all of its work was surely grounded on that premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Our decision in &lt;em&gt;Hohn&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/524/236"&gt;524 U. S. 236 (1998)&lt;/a&gt;, is equally telling.  That case concerned &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2253#c"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2253(c)&lt;/a&gt;, which requires a federal prisoner to obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) before he may appeal a district court’s adverse decision in a §2255 proceeding.  The jurisdictional question before the Court was whether a court of appeals’ denial of a COA is a “case” within the meaning of §1254(1) and thus reviewable on certiorari.  524 U. S., at 241.  Concluding that it is, the Court leaned heavily on a comparison between §2253(c) and §2244(b)(3)(E).  The latter provision, the Court said, imposes a “clear limit” on our jurisdiction.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 250.  And, the Court reasoned, the existence of that “clear limit,” coupled with the absence of comparable language in §2253(c), suggested that federal prisoners may seek certiorari to challenge an adverse COA decision.  See &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 249–250.  Much as in &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;, the Court in &lt;em&gt;Hohn&lt;/em&gt; may not have expressly reached a holding about §2244(b)(3)(E)’s meaning.  But its work only makes sense if that provision “clear[ly]” precludes certiorari jurisdiction for federal prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  Really, the idea that §2244(b)(3)(E) applies to federal prisoners and bars them from seeking certiorari has been uncontroversial since AEDPA’s adoption three decades ago.  So much so that, until recently, even the author of today’s majority opinion accepted it.  In another case involving Mr. Bowe (yes, the same Mr. Bowe), our colleague urged the Court to consider accepting an &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; habeas petition to resolve the very same do-over circuit split now before us.  &lt;em&gt;In re Bowe&lt;/em&gt;, 601 U. S. ___ (2024) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Sotomayor, J.&lt;/span&gt;, statement respecting denial of habeas corpus).  Invoking that unusual procedure, our colleague insisted, was necessary precisely because “§2244(b)(3)(E)’s bar on petitioning for review” would preclude Mr. Bowe from invoking our certiorari jurisdiction.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  That was right then, and it is right still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; How does Mr. Bowe respond?  He does not dispute that all the rules laid out in §§2244(b)(3)(A) through (E) apply to state prisoners.  As a result, he acknowledges, neither state prisoners nor state officials may challenge an appellate panel’s certification decision on certiorari.  Accordingly, there are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; two ways to resolve circuit splits about §2244 in the state-prisoner context: original habeas writs and certification under §1254(2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Even when it comes to federal prisoners, Mr. Bowe cedes much ground.  He admits that §2255(h) subjects federal prisoners to the same rules that apply to state prisoners in §§2244(b)(3)(A), (B), (C), and (D).  Brief for Petitioner 32.  He concedes, too, that every court of appeals to consider the issue has held that subparagraph (E) also applies to federal prisoners.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 15.  Still, Mr. Bowe insists, he’s discovered something all those courts (and this one) have missed for the past 30 years:  Subparagraph (E)—and it alone—doesn’t apply to federal prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  His theory runs this way.  Section 2255(h) instructs that a federal prisoner’s second or successive attack “must be certified as provided in section 2244.”  That language, Mr. Bowe submits, sweeps in only those parts of §2244 that address how an appellate panel goes about certifying a second or successive filing.  And it does not sweep in subparagraph (E) because—unlike all of §2244(b)(3)’s other subparagraphs—it does not “provide” for certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; It may be a wonderfully convenient theory for Mr. Bowe, but no court has adopted it for good reason.  Just look again at the block quotation of statutory text above.  Each and every one of §2244(b)(3)’s subparagraphs “provide[s]” for how a second or successive collateral attack “must be certified” by a “panel of the appropriate court of appeals.”  §2255(h).  Subparagraph (A) routes the certification decision to a court of appeals.  Subparagraph (B) directs that the decision must be made by a three-judge panel.  Subparagraph (C) sets forth the standard the panel must use when deciding whether to certify.  Subparagraph (D) specifies the timing for a decision.  And subparagraph (E) provides that panel certification is the exclusive avenue for certification decisions (without foreclosing the panel from asking this Court, via §1254(2), for “instructions” on “question[s] of law” along the way).  What begins with an application to a three-judge panel under subparagraph (A) ends with its disposition by that same panel under subparagraph (E).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Notice, too, the hash Mr. Bowe’s interpretation makes of the rest of the statute.  Subparagraph (B) mandates that a certification motion “shall be determined by a three-judge panel of the court of appeals.”  What would be the point of that direction if, as Mr. Bowe suggests, a prisoner could petition a court of appeals (en banc) or this Court (on certiorari) to certify a second or successive collateral attack instead?  Plainly, subparagraph (E) works in tandem with subparagraph (B) to ensure that the certification decision  comes from, and only from, a three-judge panel.  Ignoring (E) undermines (B).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Ignoring (E) also makes a nonsense of subparagraph (D)’s instruction requiring a panel to grant or deny certification within 30 days.  That mandate is perfectly sensible if, as subparagraph (E) provides, the decision of a three-judge panel is final.  But it is wholly insensible if, as Mr. Bowe supposes, any prisoner can seek panel rehearing, then en banc rehearing, and certiorari too.  The entire point of AEDPA and its certification process was to “reduce delays,” &lt;em&gt;Rhines&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Weber&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/544/269"&gt;544 U. S. 269&lt;/a&gt;, 276 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted), and “advance the finality of criminal convictions,” &lt;em&gt;Mayle&lt;/em&gt;, 545 U. S., at 662.   Yet on Mr. Bowe’s reading, the certification process alone would typically take not 30 days but many multiples of that.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;C&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Mr. Bowe’s line of argument, understandably, causes my colleagues some discomfort.  Thankfully, they are unwilling to say—as Mr. Bowe does—that every court of appeals to have reached the issue has erred in holding that subparagraph (E) bars federal prisoners from seeking panel or en banc rehearing.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 16.  To avoid calling those sound decisions into question, the majority pivots in a different direction.  On its theory, even if subparagraph (E) bars federal prisoners from pursuing petitions for panel and en banc rehearing, the statute does not bar them from seeking certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  There is an obvious reason Mr. Bowe did not press that eccentric theory before us:  It cannot be squared with the statutory text.  Section 2255 instructs that a federal prisoner’s second or successive attack “must be certified as provided in section 2244.”  And what subparagraph (E) “provide[s]” is a package deal.  The statute bars rehearing petitions and certiorari petitions in a single breath:  It provides that a panel’s certification decision “shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.”  §2244(b)(3)(E).  The notion that all of subparagraph (E) might apply to federal prisoners minus the six words “or for a writ of certiorari” is utterly implausible as a textual matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; One might think this problem would cause the majority to hesitate.  Instead, my colleagues plow on, conjuring up a clear-statement rule to support their course.  Yes, the majority admits, a fair reading of §2255(h)’s cross-reference to §2244 “might include” §2244(b)(3)(E)’s certiorari bar.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 19.  But, my colleagues insist, Congress “must speak clearly” when it wishes to withdraw our certiorari jurisdiction, &lt;em&gt;ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 8, and the language Congress employed here is not “clear” enough to be worth following&lt;em&gt;, ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 12–14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; There’s no avoiding the odd contours of the majority’s clear-statement rule.  Apparently, Congress may restrict and channel collateral review in the lower courts, as it has done in subparagraphs (A) through (D).  Congress may also bar petitions for panel or en banc rehearing, as it has done in subparagraph (E), cutting off the usual method by which a court of appeals “reconcile[s] its internal difficulties.”  &lt;em&gt;Wisniewski&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/353/901"&gt;353 U. S. 901&lt;/a&gt;, 902 (1957) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).  Seemingly, Congress can do all that without having to satisfy any clear-statement rule.  The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; work the majority’s rule performs concerns certiorari petitions—and the &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;effect that rule has is to pencil out subparagraph (E)’s six words “or for a writ of certiorari” in cases  involving federal prisoners.  All while leaving those same six words in force when it comes to state prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; That gerrymandered rule may suit Mr. Bowe’s present needs and appeal to our vanity.  But it is pointless.  Even if a clear statement were required here, Congress gave us one.  For all the reasons explored above, AEDPA’s certiorari bar imposes, in &lt;em&gt;Hohn&lt;/em&gt;’s words, a “clear limit” on our jurisdiction.  See Part I–A, &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;.  Nor, again, is there any need to pretend otherwise just to address the circuit split Mr. Bowe identifies, for we can just as easily reach it through certification under §1254(2) as we can through certiorari under §1254(1).  Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit refused to invoke §1254(2) only because it believed we would deny certification—a belief we could easily dispel in this case simply by saying it isn’t so.  See App. 78–79.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Worse still, the majority’s bespoke certiorari-for-federal-prisoners-clear-statement rule lacks any grounding in law.  Just ask yourself:  If not from thin air, where could such a rule possibly come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Perhaps the most obvious candidate would be the Constitution.  Sometimes, after all, when faced with two competing statutory interpretations this Court invokes the canon of constitutional avoidance to choose the one that avoids, rather than implicates, a constitutional problem.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Clark&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Martinez&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/543/371"&gt;543 U. S. 371&lt;/a&gt;, 381–382 (2005).  But the majority does not rest its clear-statement rule on that doctrine.  Nor could it.  This Court has already expressly rejected the notion that §2244(b)(3)’s limitations violate the Suspension Clause or the Exceptions Clause, the two constitutional provisions most obviously relevant to cases like this one.  See &lt;em&gt;Felker&lt;/em&gt;, 518 U. S., at&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;661–664.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; That should come as no surprise either.  The writ of habeas corpus traditionally addressed cases of executive detention without trial.  Accordingly, a federal prisoner was ineligible for habeas corpus if he had been convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction.  See &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 663; &lt;em&gt;Brown&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Davenport&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/118"&gt;596 U. S. 118&lt;/a&gt;, 128–129 (2022).  It was not until the 20th century that this Court began allowing federal prisoners to mount collateral attacks on jurisdictionally sound convictions.  Cf. &lt;em&gt;Glasgow&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Moyer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/225/420"&gt;225 U. S. 420&lt;/a&gt;, 429 (1912) (“The principle of the cases is the simple one that if a court has jurisdiction of the case the writ of &lt;em&gt;habeas corpus&lt;/em&gt; cannot be employed to re-try the issues, whether of law, constitutional or other, or of fact”).  Put simply, for much of our Nation’s history, there was no collateral review of the vast majority of convictions, much less a right to certiorari in such cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; With constitutional avoidance off the table, the majority advances an unbriefed theory to prop up its novel clear-statement rule.  Citing &lt;em&gt;Boechler&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Commissioner&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/199"&gt;596 U. S. 199 (2022)&lt;/a&gt;, the majority observes that this Court generally reads statutorily prescribed procedural requirements as forfeitable claim-processing rules rather than unwavering jurisdictional mandates unless Congress “clearly” indicates otherwise.  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 11.  And, the majority insists, it is doing something similar here.  See&lt;em&gt; ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  Hardly.  No one disputes that AEDPA’s certiorari bar at issue here &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; jurisdictional.  So &lt;em&gt;Boechler&lt;/em&gt; not only does not “contro[l] this case,” &lt;em&gt;ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 11, n. 5, it has nothing to say about this case at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The majority’s invocation of &lt;em&gt;Boechler&lt;/em&gt; is not just inapt, it is unfortunate.  Two years ago, in an obscure administrative law case, this Court expressly refused to treat &lt;em&gt;Boechler&lt;/em&gt; as&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a permission slip for creating any manner of new interpretive presumptions that may happen to suit our tastes but that do not “approximat[e] rea[l]” statutory meaning.  Compare &lt;em&gt;Loper Bright Enterprises&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Raimondo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/603/369"&gt;603 U. S. 369&lt;/a&gt;, 455, n. 1 (2024) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Kagan, J.&lt;/span&gt;, dissenting) (arguing that, in light of cases like &lt;em&gt;Boechler&lt;/em&gt;, we may as well accept other interpretive fictions like &lt;em&gt;Chevron&lt;/em&gt;), with 603 U. S., at 399 (majority opinion) (holding otherwise).  Yet that is exactly how the majority treats &lt;em&gt;Boechler&lt;/em&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  The picture does not improve from there.  The &lt;em&gt;Boechler&lt;/em&gt; clear-statement rule operates only in a particular context and exists only for particular reasons.  Treating too many rules as jurisdictional rather than as claim-processing rules, this Court has said, would “result in the waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants.”  &lt;em&gt;Henderson&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Shinseki&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/428"&gt;562 U. S. 428&lt;/a&gt;, 434 (2011).  Yet neither of those rationales applies here.  If anything, it is the majority’s new rule that promises to waste judicial resources by undermining finality.  And there is no colorable argument that Congress acts unfairly by preventing both prisoners and governments from appealing adverse certification decisions.  Far from respecting &lt;em&gt;Boechler&lt;/em&gt;, then, the majority more nearly defies it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; With &lt;em&gt;Boechler&lt;/em&gt; a dry hole, the majority finds itself forced to prospect elsewhere for legal authority.  Its next stop is &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 8–10.  But the majority’s quote mining of that decision only winds up highlighting just how unprecedented its course today really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;, remember, the government advocated for a lopsided construction of §2244(b)(3)(E).  On the government’s view, the statute permitted it to seek certiorari to challenge a circuit decision granting certification, but precluded a federal prisoner from seeking certiorari to challenge a circuit decision denying certification.  540 U. S., at 380.  As we have seen, the Court rejected that submission for two reasons.  First, the prisoner there did not seek to pursue a second or successive attack subject to subparagraph (E).  Second, the government’s reading would have “close[d] our doors to a class of habeas petitioners seeking review” while leaving those same doors open to the government.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 381.  Expanding on the second rationale, the Court said it would not endorse such an “anomal[ous]” reading of subparagraph (E) “without any clear indication that such was Congress’ intent.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 380–381.  Doubtless, this commentary reflected an intuition that Congress would not lightly treat  similarly situated litigants differently.  But none of that speaks to the situation before us, where the construction of subparagraph (E) at issue is fair and square: no certiorari review of certification decisions, no matter who won below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; If anything, and as we have seen, &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; does more to hurt than help the majority’s cause.  See Part I–A, &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;.  Throughout that decision, the Court took as given that subparagraph (E) &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; bar federal prisoners from seeking certiorari to challenge adverse certification decisions regarding their second or successive filings.  Why (again) would &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; take the trouble to explain that the challenge there wasn’t a second or successive one if subparagraph (E) doesn’t apply to federal prisoners anyway?  And why would &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; worry about the anomalous possibility that only the government may seek certiorari when, in fact, federal prisoners can too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The majority offers no colorable answers to these questions because none can be had.  Just like &lt;em&gt;Hohn&lt;/em&gt; and our colleague’s opinion two years ago in &lt;em&gt;In re Bowe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt; fully appreciated that subparagraph (E) imposes a “&lt;em&gt;clear limit&lt;/em&gt;” on our certiorari jurisdiction, one applicable to federal and state prisoners alike.  &lt;em&gt;Hohn&lt;/em&gt;, 524 U. S., at 250 (emphasis added); see also &lt;em&gt;In re Bowe&lt;/em&gt;, 601 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (acknowledging that “§2244(b)(3)(E)’s bar on petitioning for review” would preclude Mr. Bowe himself from seeking certiorari).&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  Unable to identify any plausible authority in existing law for its clear-statement rule, the majority is ultimately left to summon it from the ether.  To be sure, my colleagues begin by pointing to the (unremarkable) principle that this Court does not read “statutory silence as implicitly modifying or limiting . . . jurisdiction that another statute specifically grants.”  &lt;em&gt;Hertz Corp.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Friend&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/559/77"&gt;559 U. S. 77&lt;/a&gt;, 83 (2010); &lt;em&gt;Felker&lt;/em&gt;, 518 U. S., at 660–661.  But from there, the majority engages in pure invention, devising a broad new legal rule that even &lt;em&gt;express&lt;/em&gt; limitations on our certiorari jurisdiction are unenforceable absent a clear statement.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; What a leap that is.  This case is nothing like those in which we have historically declined to infer limitations on our certiorari jurisdiction based on statutory &lt;em&gt;silence&lt;/em&gt;.  All agree that §2255(h) &lt;em&gt;expressly &lt;/em&gt;incorporates portions of §2244(b)(3).  All agree that §2244(b)(3)(E) &lt;em&gt;expressly&lt;/em&gt; bars “petition[s] for . . . writ[s] of certiorari.”  The only point of disagreement concerns how those explicit provisions fit together.  I believe they fit together in a way that deprives us of jurisdiction.  But even if I am wrong about that, this is hardly a case of “silen[t] or ambiguous” text, &lt;em&gt;Hertz&lt;/em&gt;, 559 U. S., at 83–84, nor one involving provisions that “mak[e] no mention of our authority,” &lt;em&gt;Felker&lt;/em&gt;, 518 U. S., at 661.  Truly, the majority’s clear-statement rule comes from nowhere at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In the end, neither Mr. Bowe’s textual arguments nor the majority’s atextual theory can obscure AEDPA’s message, one every court of appeals (and this Court) has understood since 1996.  A litigant like Mr. Bowe may seek to pursue an original habeas petition in this Court.  A court of appeals may certify questions to us.  But §2244 bars state prisoners (and governments) from invoking our certiorari jurisdiction to challenge adverse certification decisions.  Section 2255  extends that bar to federal prisoners.  And because that bar applies here, we lack jurisdiction to decide this case.  The majority’s conclusion otherwise is as improbable as it is novel.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Because the majority concludes that we have jurisdiction to reach the merits, I offer my views too.  The question here, recall, concerns the Eleventh Circuit’s refusal to certify Mr. Bowe’s latest collateral attack.  Like most other circuits, the Eleventh Circuit has held that §2244(b)(1) bars do-over claims by both state and federal prisoners.  And that provision, the court reasoned, barred Mr. Bowe’s present challenge because he has already pursued the same challenge many times before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  In reversing the Eleventh Circuit, my colleagues do not question that §2244(b)(1) prohibits state prisoners’ do-over claims.  Nor do my colleagues question that Mr. Bowe seeks to pursue a do-over claim in this case.  Instead, they hold that federal prisoners like him are free to file in district court as many do-over claims as they please.  Once more, I disagree because I see nothing in AEDPA’s text that supports that kind of special treatment for federal prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Begin by walking through the relevant statutory provisions.  Section 2255 requires a federal prisoner to satisfy two essential requirements before he can pursue a second or successive challenge.  First, his filing must “contain” either new facts or new law sufficient to satisfy §2255(h)(1) or (h)(2).  Second, his filing “must be certified” by a court of appeals under the rules outlined in §2244.  And to win certification under §2244, everyone accepts, a federal prisoner must satisfy at least §§2244(b)(3)(A), (B), (C), and (D).  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 12–13.  (With jurisdiction now out of the picture, we can set aside the dispute over (E).)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; From there the right answer lies only a few steps away.  Section 2244(b)(3)(C) states that “[t]he court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application &lt;em&gt;satisfies the requirements of this subsection&lt;/em&gt;.”  (Emphasis added.)  No one questions that this provision applies to state and federal prisoners equally.  Brief for Petitioner 32; Brief for United States 25–26; &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 12–13.  So by its terms, this provision means a federal prisoner must make “a prima facie showing” in a court of appeals that his second or successive filing satisfies the requirements of “this subsection”—namely, subsection (b) of §2244.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; That tells us all we need to know.  The very first provision of subsection (b) prohibits do-over claims.  In the words of  §2244(b)(1), any claim presented in a prior application “shall be dismissed.”  As a result, AEDPA no more tolerates repetitive litigation by federal prisoners than it does by state prisoners.  And the Eleventh Circuit was right to deny Mr. Bowe leave to file again the same claim he had already pursued many times before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; What the statutory language teaches on this point, context confirms.  Next to subsection (b)(1) sits subsection (b)(2).  There, Congress addressed second or successive filings presenting new (as opposed to do-over) claims.  As laid out in the margin, subsection (b)(2)’s rules for state prisoners’ new claims are similar to, but different from, §2255(h)’s rules for federal prisoners’ new claims.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  And because §2255(h) applies particularly to federal prisoners, its specific requirements displace §2244(b)(2)’s more generally applicable ones.  See &lt;em&gt;Baltimore Nat. Bank&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;State Tax Comm’n of Md.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/297/209"&gt;297 U. S. 209&lt;/a&gt;, 215 (1936).  So when a court of appeals asks whether a federal prisoner has made a “prima facie showing” that his proposed filing “satisfies the requirements of this subsection” under §2244(b)(3)(C), the requirements of §§2255(h)(1)–(2) step into the shoes that §2244(b)(2) would otherwise fill.  Tellingly, however, §2255(h) contains no such federal-prisoner-specific language when it comes to do-over claims.  Instead, it leaves §2244(b)(1)’s generally applicable language in place.  All of  which suggests that §2244(b)(1) applies no less to federal prisoners than to state prisoners—just as the text says.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Another contextual clue comes from the 30-day clock.  Just as with §2244(b)(3)(C), no one questions that §2244(b)(3)(D) applies to both federal and state prisoners.  Under that provision, a federal court of appeals has just 30 days to issue a certification decision.  Complying with that tight deadline is possible if courts of appeals can dispose of do-over claims without further inquiry.  But complying is a good deal harder if panels must ask whether each and every proposed collateral attack involves new evidence of innocence or a retroactively applicable rule of constitutional law.  In this case, for example, it took me five minutes to appreciate that Mr. Bowe has already advanced, many times before, the same claim he proposes to pursue here.  I do not know, nor would it be so easy to determine, whether Mr. Bowe’s latest filing makes a compelling showing of new facts or new law.  Contra, &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 23 (majority erroneously suggesting that determining whether a litigant “has raised a claim before” is no easier than determining whether he has identified compelling new facts or law).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Statutory structure and history, too, have something to say.  Before AEDPA, separate provisions addressed do-over claims by state prisoners and federal prisoners.  Back then, §2244 permitted (but did not require) a court to deny relief to a state prisoner who “present[ed] no new ground not heretofore presented and determined” in a prior  application.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2244#a"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2244(a)&lt;/a&gt; (1988 ed.); &lt;a href="/rio/citation/62_Stat._965"&gt;62 Stat. 965&lt;/a&gt;–966.  Similarly, §2255 said that a court “shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief ” by a federal prisoner.  See &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2255"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2255&lt;/a&gt; (1988 ed.).  In AEDPA, Congress amended both provisions.  Now, §2255(h) channels second or successive §2255 motions through the §2244 rules applicable to state prisoners.  And AEDPA added to §2244 a new mandatory (no longer permissive) bar against do-over claims, flatly directing that they “shall be dismissed.”  §2244(b)(1); &lt;a href="/rio/citation/110_Stat._1220"&gt;110 Stat. 1220&lt;/a&gt;–1221.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Exactly nothing in this history or AEDPA’s structure suggests Congress sought to loosen do-over restrictions for anyone—let alone completely do away with those restrictions for federal prisoners.  To the contrary, the statute’s history and structure suggest, as we have long observed, that AEDPA imposed new and “strict[er] limit[s]” on postconviction relief.  &lt;em&gt;Jones&lt;/em&gt;, 599 U. S., at 476.  All of which indicates, once again, that Congress meant what it said in §2244(b)(3)(C):  The “requirements of this subsection” apply to federal and state prisoners alike—and those requirements include subsection (b)(1)’s bar on do-over claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Seeking some way to justify a rule prohibiting state prisoners from pursuing do-over claims—but also allowing federal prisoners to do just that—Mr. Bowe and the majority offer a grab bag of unpersuasive theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; First, the majority observes that §2244(a) specifically references “section 2255,” the provision governing federal prisoners’ collateral attacks, while §2244(b)(1) contains no such reference.  Because “we presume differences in language . . . convey differences in meaning,” the majority submits, it must follow that §2244(b)(1)’s bar on do-over claims “applies only to state prisoners.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But that cannot be right.   Section 2244 mentions “section 2255” only one time, in §2244(a).  If its absence elsewhere mattered, then none of the rules in §§2244(b)(3)(A) through (D) would apply to federal prisoners.  Yet not even the majority or Mr. Bowe thinks that.  To the contrary, both concede that the whole point of §2255(h)’s cross-reference to §2244 is to ensure federal prisoners, just like their state counterparts, must follow each of those provisions.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 12–13; Brief for Petitioner 32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Second, and in a similar vein, Mr. Bowe stresses that subsection (b)(1) prohibits do-over claims “in a second or successive habeas corpus &lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;under section 2254&lt;/em&gt;.”  (Emphasis added.)  Seeking to capitalize on the italicized language, Mr. Bowe notes that §2254 governs postconviction “applications” by state prisoners, while federal prisoners proceed by way of §2255 “motions.”  Given that difference in nomenclature, Mr. Bowe contends, subsection (b)(1) must apply only to state prisoners because that provision addresses “applications” and not “motions.”  The majority briefly nods in the same direction.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This argument fails for much the same reason as its predecessor.  If the absence of the word “motion” in §2244 made all the difference, then none of §§2244(b)(3)(A) through (D)’s rules would apply to federal prisoners because each of those provisions speaks only of “applications.”  Yet, no one believes that.  Instead, everyone appreciates, §2255 routes federal prisoners’ “motions” through all those provisions.  In each, then, the word “applications” is best read as interchangeable with “motions,” just as most circuits have understood.  Cf. &lt;em&gt;Magwood &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Patterson&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/561/320"&gt;561 U. S. 320&lt;/a&gt;, 324, n. 1 (2010) (“Although &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2244#b"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2244(b)&lt;/a&gt; refers to a habeas ‘application,’ we use the word ‘petition’ interchangeably”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Third, Mr. Bowe replies that there’s something else special about subsection (b)(1).  Unlike §§2244(b)(3)(A) through (D), he says, subsection (b)(1) doesn’t just speak of “applications,” but “application[s] &lt;em&gt;under section 2254.&lt;/em&gt;”   (Emphasis added.)  And that more specific reference, Mr. Bowe insists, means subsection (b)(1) cannot apply to federal prisoners proceeding under §2255.  But this argument doesn’t move the needle either.  If (as it must be and as no one seriously disputes) the term “application” in §2244 is best read as embracing a federal §2255 “motion,” then the phrase “application under section 2254” in §2244 should likewise be understood to embrace a “motion under section 2255.”&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Fourth, the majority suggests that §2255(h)’s cross-reference to §2244 captures only the latter’s “procedures” governing “how a panel certifies a second or successive filing.” &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 21.  And, the argument goes, §2244(b)(1)’s bar on do-over claims is no mere “procedure” but instead a substantive rule about what a filing may “contai[n].”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  This theory fails too.  Section 2255’s cross-reference does not speak of a procedure/substance distinction.  Instead, §2255(h) directs courts to “certif[y]” motions “as provided in” §2244.  Even the majority acknowledges that this language makes §2244(b)(3)(C) applicable to federal prisoners.  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 12–13.  And subparagraph (C) explicitly says “the requirements of this subsection”—which include §2244(b)(1)—must be satisfied before certification.  It’s more than a little telling that the majority finds itself forced  both to rewrite §2255(h)’s terms and to ignore §2244(b)(3)(C)’s directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Finally, Mr. Bowe retreats to the position that federal prisoners &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be exempt from subsection (b)(1) because AEDPA was designed to treat state prisoners more harshly than federal prisoners.  But, in fact, AEDPA often treats the two groups the same, and not just when it comes to second or successive filings.  To take just one example, §2253(c) requires a prisoner to secure a “certificate of appealability” before appealing from a habeas &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; §2255 loss in federal district court.  State and federal prisoners alike thus must satisfy that provision’s demands.  See §2253(c); cf. §2266(a) (requiring identical treatment for certain state- and federal-prisoner filings).  And it should shock no one that Congress might proceed similarly here and exhibit an intolerance for do-over claims no matter who seeks to pursue them.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;*&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The majority today commits two serious mistakes.  First, in its zeal to resolve a circuit split, the majority asserts jurisdiction where we have none.  With statutory text and 30 years of case law in this Court and lower courts aligned  against it, the majority bases its claim of jurisdiction on a new and curiously contoured clear-statement rule that is as needless as it is unprecedented.  Second, and compounding its jurisdictional overreach, the majority adopts an implausible view on the merits.  AEDPA didn’t suddenly free federal prisoners from pre-existing restrictions on do-over claims.  Just the opposite:  It imposed additional “carefully crafted limits” on collateral attacks by federal and state prisoners alike.  &lt;em&gt;Jones&lt;/em&gt;, 599 U. S., at 482.  And, quite unsurprisingly, one of those limits includes an unmistakable and absolute bar on do-over claims.  Because neither of the majority’s innovations are compatible with Congress’s directions in AEDPA, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-2ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  Put aside for the moment AEDPA’s additional instructions about do-over claims—they become relevant only when we come to the merits.  See Part II, &lt;em&gt;infra&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  Mr. Bowe suggests this is no problem because subparagraph (E) allows courts of appeals to order rehearing &lt;em&gt;sua sponte&lt;/em&gt;.  And having discovered porosity in this otherwise solid subparagraph, Mr. Bowe wonders why we need to worry about finality at all.  But even if AEDPA tolerates&lt;em&gt; sua sponte&lt;/em&gt; rehearing, that is no threat to finality because &lt;em&gt;sua sponte &lt;/em&gt;rehearing is rare, and judges do not call for it needlessly.  The same is true of certification under §1254(2), for that matter.  These modest, rarely employed, and judicially initiated procedures are hardly camels’ noses poking under AEDPA’s tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-4ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;  Attempting to wring more yet from &lt;em&gt;Castro&lt;/em&gt;, the majority points to its citation of &lt;em&gt;Utah &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Evans&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/536/452"&gt;536 U. S. 452 (2002)&lt;/a&gt;, for the “principle that we read limitations on our jurisdiction to review narrowly.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 10 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But &lt;em&gt;Evans&lt;/em&gt; simply applied the anodyne presumption that federal agency action is amenable to &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; form of judicial review.  See 536 U. S., at 463 (citing &lt;em&gt;Webster&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Doe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/486/592"&gt;486 U. S. 592 (1988)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Bowen&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Michigan Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/476/667"&gt;476 U. S. 667 (1986)&lt;/a&gt;).  That presumption speaks not at all to the postconviction setting, let alone second or successive collateral attacks like this one.  In this context, a litigant has already enjoyed extensive judicial review, including at least two opportunities to seek certiorari from us—first on direct review, and again in a first postconviction challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-5ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;  In a final foray, Mr. Bowe and &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt; contend that, even if subparagraph (E)’s certiorari bar generally applies to federal prisoners, it still does not apply in this particular case.  Mr. Bowe’s version of the argument goes like this.  Subparagraph (E) bars certiorari petitions from appellate orders that “grant or den[y]” certification to pursue a second or successive attack.  And, Mr. Bowe submits, that language doesn’t apply to him because the Eleventh Circuit “dismissed” rather than “denied” his certification request.  See App. 79.  This argument fails, though, because “the label attached to an order is not dispositive”; its “ ‘practical effect’ ” is.  &lt;em&gt;Abbott&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Perez&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/579"&gt;585 U. S. 579&lt;/a&gt;, 594 (2018).  And here, the practical effect of the Eleventh Circuit’s “dismissal” order was to &lt;em&gt;deny&lt;/em&gt; Mr. Bowe permission to pursue his second or successive attack.  &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt;’s version of the argument proceeds differently.  She admits that a dismissal may have the practical effect of a denial.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 2 (concurring opinion).  But, she insists, that doesn’t hold true here because, by applying §2244(b)(1)’s do-over bar, the Eleventh Circuit applied the wrong “statutory criteria” to Mr. Bowe.  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 4.  There is just one problem.  The statute bars review of any “grant or denial,” not any “grant or denial made after applying the correct statutory criteria.”  &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt; identifies nothing in the statute’s terms that might allow us to turn the Eleventh Circuit’s (supposed) &lt;em&gt;merits&lt;/em&gt; error into a &lt;em&gt;jurisdictionally&lt;/em&gt; decisive event.  A denial is a denial.  Recognizing the flaws of both versions of the argument, the majority rightly adopts neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-6ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  Section 2244(b)(2)(B)’s new-facts provision requires that “(i) the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence; and “(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.” In contrast, §2255(h)(1)’s new-facts provision requires “newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-7ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;  The majority claims my understanding of how §2244(b)(2) and §2255(h) interact renders §2255(h)(2) “mere surplusage.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 22–23.  But that claim is easily falsified.  If §2255(h)(2) really were “mere surplusage,” then it could be struck out of the statute with no change.  So, then, imagine a version of §2255(h) without subsection (h)(2).  That imaginary provision would require &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; “second or successive motion . . . to contain . . . newly discovered evidence” capable of satisfying subsection (h)(1)’s new-facts requirement.  That is very different from the real §2255(h), which allows a prisoner to show &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; new facts, §2255(h)(1), &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; new law, §2255(h)(2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-8ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;  That is not to say that subsection (b)(1)’s specific reference to §2254 applications, rather than to applications &lt;em&gt;simpliciter&lt;/em&gt;, is superfluous.  It has considerable work to do—just not the work Mr. Bowe supposes.  By referencing §2254, the statute makes plain that the do-over bar applies only to applications (or motions, as the case may be) by prisoners seeking postconviction relief.  That renders it inapplicable to habeas applications from state prisoners in preconviction executive detention, because those applications are filed under §2241 rather than §2254.  And that distinction (unlike the one Mr. Bowe proposes between state and federal prisoners) makes sense.  Convicted prisoners, by definition, have already received a great deal of judicial process, so a do-over bar makes sense as to them.  Prisoners who haven’t been convicted, meanwhile, stand in very different shoes, so Congress decided to exempt them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-9ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;  The government offers two additional theories for Mr. Bowe on the merits.  But the majority pursues neither theory, and rightly so.  For one, the government appears to suggest that subsection (b)(1) &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; applies during a court of appeals’ certification proceeding for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; prisoner—state or federal.  Only after certification, on this view, may a district court weed out do-over claims under subsection (b)(1).  See Brief for United States 44–45.  But, among other defects, the government’s view would imply that not only (b)(1) but also (b)(2) is inapplicable during certification.  And, of course, that would render the whole certification process pointless.  For another, the government suggests that, even if §2244(b)(1)’s do-over bar applies to federal prisoners, that rule does not apply in this particular case because Mr. Bowe never actually filed a previous collateral attack containing a &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt; claim; he only sought leave to do so.  Reply Brief 10–11.  But we did not take this case to address that case-specific argument, nor did Mr. Bowe himself clearly advance it before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;certiorari to the supreme court of montana &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 24–624. Argued October 15, 2025—Decided January 14, 2026&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Stuart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/547/398"&gt;547 U. S. 398&lt;/a&gt;, 400, the Court held&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; allows police officers to enter a home without a warrant if they have an “objectively reasonable basis for believing” that someone inside needs emergency assistance.  In this case, Montana police officers responded to the home of petitioner William Case after his ex-girlfriend called 9–1–1 to report that he was threatening suicide and may have shot himself.  The officers knocked on the doors and yelled into an open window, but got no response.  They could see an empty handgun holster and something that looked like a suicide note inside, and they ultimately decided to enter the home to render emergency aid.  When one officer approached a bedroom closet in which Case was hiding, Case threw open the closet curtain while holding an object that looked like a gun.  Fearing that he was about to be shot, the officer shot and injured Case.  An ambulance was called to take Case to the hospital, and officers found a handgun next to where Case had stood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  Case was charged with assaulting a police officer.  Case moved to suppress all evidence obtained from the home entry, arguing that the police violated the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; by entering without a warrant.  The trial court denied the motion, and a jury found Case guilty.  A divided Montana Supreme Court upheld the officers’ entry as lawful under Montana’s caretaker doctrine, rejecting the contention that an officer must have probable cause to believe that an occupant needs emergency aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Held&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;’s objective reasonableness standard for warrantless home entries to render emergency aid applies without further gloss and was satisfied in this case.  Pp. 5–11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  (a) “[S]earches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable” under the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;, 547 U. S., at 403.  But the “warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions,” &lt;em&gt;Lange&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;California&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/295"&gt;594 U. S. 295&lt;/a&gt;, 301, including the need to render emergency assistance.  The Court first approved a warrantless home entry to render emergency assistance in &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;, holding that officers may enter when they have “an objectively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant is seriously injured or imminently threatened with such injury.”  547 U. S., at 400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Montana Supreme Court’s opinion below strayed from that rule.  Most important, the emergency-aid test incorporated in Montana’s caretaker doctrine evokes the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; standard of “reasonable suspicion” that applies to relatively non-invasive street stops.  But &lt;em&gt;Brigham City &lt;/em&gt;adopted a different standard for home entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Case now urges the Court to understand &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt; as sounding in probable cause, but the Court declines to put a new probable-cause spin onto the emergency-aid standard.  Probable cause is “peculiarly related to criminal investigations,” &lt;em&gt;Treasury Employees&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Von Raab&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/489/656"&gt;489 U. S. 656&lt;/a&gt;, 667, and that body of law would fit awkwardly, if at all, in the non-criminal, non-investigatory setting at issue here.  Rather than strain to relate probable-cause decisions to emergency-aid situations, &lt;em&gt;Brigham City &lt;/em&gt;asked simply whether an officer had “an objectively reasonable basis for believing” that entry was direly needed to prevent or deal with serious harm.  547 U. S., at 400.  Courts should assess the reasonableness of an emergency-aid entry on its own terms, rather than through the lens generally used to consider investigative activity.  Pp. 5–9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; (b) The officers here had an “objectively reasonable basis for believing” that their entry was needed to prevent Case from ending his life.  The information the officers obtained from Case’s ex-girlfriend, combined with their observations at the scene, suggested that Case may already have shot himself or would do so absent intervention.  The officers’ decision to enter his home to prevent that result was reasonable.  Accordingly, the Court affirms the judgment (even though not all the reasoning) of the Montana Supreme Court.  Pp. 9–11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;417 Mont. 354, 553 P. 3d 985, affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Kagan&lt;/span&gt;, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt;, J., and &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt;, J., filed concurring opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;WILLIAM TREVOR CASE, PETITIONER &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; MONTANA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on writ of certiorari to the supreme court  of montana&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[January 14, 2026]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Kagan&lt;/span&gt; delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Stuart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/547/398"&gt;547 U. S. 398&lt;/a&gt;, 400 (2006), this Court held that police officers may enter a home without a warrant if they have an “objectively reasonable basis for believing” that someone inside needs emergency assistance.  The question presented is whether that standard means that officers must have “probable cause” for the intrusion, as they typically would when investigating a crime.  We hold it does not.  The probable-cause requirement is rooted in, and derives its meaning from, the criminal context, and we decline to transplant it to this different one.  &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;’s reasonableness standard means just what it says, with no further gloss.  And here it was satisfied because the police had “an objectively reasonable basis for believing” that a homeowner intended to take his own life and, indeed, may already have shot himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This case began with an alarming phone call—from petitioner William Case to his ex-girlfriend J. H., both residents of a small town in Montana.  Case told J. H. on the call that “he was going to kill himself.”  App. 67 (testimony of J. H.).  Because Case sounded “erratic,” J. H. assumed he had been  drinking.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  She tried to talk Case out of committing suicide, but “couldn’t reel him back”: With each passing moment, Case “became more methodical about what he was going to do.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 68.  Case said that he was “going to get a note”—presumably meaning a suicide note, for J. H. or others to find.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  And then J. H. heard a “clicking” sound, like the “cock[ing of] a gun.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  J. H. told Case she was going to call the police, but that seemed only to antagonize him: Case replied “he would shoot them all too.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 69.  Finally, J. H. heard “a pop” followed by “nothing”—“just dead air.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  She “yelled [Case’s] name a few times,” but got no response, leading her to think he had “pulled the trigger.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  So she called 9–1–1 to report the incident and drove as fast as she could to Case’s home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Three police officers, dispatched to do “a welfare check on a suicidal male,” met J. H. outside the house.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 104 (testimony of officer).  They decided the situation was “very serious,” based both on what J. H. told them about the call and on what they already knew about Case.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 75, 157.  The officers were aware that Case had a history of alcohol abuse and mental-health issues; that he had previously threatened suicide at the school where he worked; and that he had once seemed to attempt “suicide-by-cop,” by confronting the police in a way that was likely to provoke a lethal response.  So the three officers requested that the chief of police come to the scene.  While waiting for him, they circled the house looking for signs of injury or danger.  They knocked on the doors and yelled into an open window, but got no response.  Shining their flashlights inside, they could make out empty beer cans, an empty handgun holster, and a notepad with writing on it, which they took to be the suicide note Case had mentioned to J. H.  At that point, however, they saw no sign of Case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Once the chief came, the officers conferred and decided to enter the house “to render emergency aid.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 198.  In the best-case scenario, they hoped to “talk [Case] down” and  prevent any injury.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 174.  But given J. H.’s account, the officers considered as well another possibility—that Case had already shot himself and might be “in there bleeding.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 85.  At the same time, they worried that if Case remained unharmed, their entry could spark a confrontation.  See &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 174, 192–193.  So they equipped themselves with long-barrel guns and a ballistic shield before going in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The officers entered the house through the front door, about 40 minutes after they first arrived.  They announced themselves loudly, and continued to call out as they walked through the home.  Case did not answer; he was hiding in the closet of a bedroom upstairs.  When one of the officers entered that room, Case threw open the closet curtain and appeared from behind it, holding “a black object” which looked like a gun.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 194.  Fearing that he was about to be shot, the officer fired his own rifle.  The bullet hit Case in the abdomen, and another officer rushed to administer first aid.  An ambulance was called to take Case to the nearest hospital (where he recovered).  Meanwhile, one of the officers found a handgun in a laundry basket next to the place where Case had stood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The county attorney charged Case with assaulting a police officer.  Case moved to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the home entry, arguing that the police had violated the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; by coming into his house without a warrant.  The trial court denied the motion on the ground that the police officers were responding legitimately to an “emergency.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a.  A Montana jury then found Case guilty of the crime charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; On appeal, a divided Montana Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s ruling that the officers’ entry was lawful.  The majority analyzed the issue under its “community caretaker doctrine.”  553 P. 3d 985, 990 (Mont. 2024).  It noted that a recent &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; decision of this Court, &lt;em&gt;Caniglia&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Strom&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/593/194"&gt;593 U. S. 194&lt;/a&gt;, 198 (2021), had rejected a “community caretaking rule” allowing a warrantless home  entry even absent a “need to render emergency assistance” to an occupant.  But the Montana court thought its community-caretaker doctrine survived that holding because it demanded such an emergency.  Under that doctrine, the court explained, police could enter a home to do a “welfare check” only when “objective, specific and articulable facts” would lead an “experienced officer [to] suspect” that a person inside “is in need of help or is in peril.”  553 P. 3d, at 990, 991.  And the court found that facts meeting that description existed here because of the likelihood of suicide.  See &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 994.  The court rejected Case’s alternative standard: that a police officer must have “probable cause to believe” the occupant in need of emergency aid.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 992.  The “probable cause” locution, the court suggested, applies only when the police are “engaged in a criminal investigation.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  The dissenting justices, by contrast, favored the proposed probable-cause rule, which they concluded the officers here did not satisfy.  See &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 996, 998 (opinion of McKinnon, J.).  In the dissent’s view, the court’s different approach resembled the “mere reasonable suspicion” standard applicable to comparatively non-invasive street stops.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 999.  That standard, the dissent thought, was too easily met to support a warrantless entry into a home.  See &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 996, 999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We granted certiorari, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/605/968"&gt;605 U. S. 968 (2025)&lt;/a&gt;, because courts have differed on whether police officers entering a home to provide emergency aid need “probable cause” to believe that an occupant is in peril.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;*  We conclude that standard, borrowed from the criminal context, is inapt.  We instead hold just what we have held before: that the officers  may enter if, but only if, they have an “objectively reasonable basis for believing” that an occupant faces serious danger.  &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;, 547 U. S., at 400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; provides that “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.”  At the “very core” of that guarantee, as this Court has often stated, “stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.”  &lt;em&gt;Caniglia&lt;/em&gt;, 593 U. S., at 198 (quoting&lt;em&gt; Florida&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Jardines&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/569/1"&gt;569 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 6 (2013)).  When the intrusion is into that most private place, “reasonableness” usually means having a warrant.  &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;, 547 U. S., at 403&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(“It is a basic principle of &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; law that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable”).  “But not always: The warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions.”  &lt;em&gt;Lange&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;California&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/295"&gt;594 U. S. 295&lt;/a&gt;, 301 (2021).  And among those is one pertinent here, involving the need to provide an occupant with emergency aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This Court first approved a warrantless home entry to render emergency assistance in &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;.  There, police officers responding to a noise complaint observed through a kitchen window a physical altercation between an adolescent and several adults.  As they watched, the teenager punched one of the adults in the face, “sending [him] to the sink spitting blood.”  547 U. S., at 406.  The officers immediately entered the home through a nearby screen door and, announcing their presence, caused the fight to cease.  We unanimously approved the warrantless entry as “reasonable under the circumstances.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  And we explained what made it so: The officers had “an objectively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant [was]  seriously injured or imminently threatened with such injury.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Three years later, in &lt;em&gt;Michigan&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Fisher&lt;/em&gt;, we reiterated what we had said in &lt;em&gt;Brigham City &lt;/em&gt;about the “emergency aid exception.”  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/558/45"&gt;558 U. S. 45&lt;/a&gt;, 47 (2009) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).  The police in &lt;em&gt;Fisher&lt;/em&gt;, also responding to a neighbor’s report, found a scene redolent of violence and danger.  Three windows were broken, with the glass strewn on the ground outside; blood was smeared on one of the doors, as well as on the smashed-in hood of a pickup truck in the driveway; and, visible through a window, a man inside the house was “screaming and throwing things” at an unseen target.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 48.  We held that the officers’ entry in those circumstances was “reasonable under the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;,” just as it had been in &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;.  558 U. S., at 48.  Using the same standard articulated there, we concluded that the officers had “an objectively reasonable basis for believing” that an occupant of the home needed immediate aid.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 47 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;, 547 U. S., at 406).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Finally, in &lt;em&gt;Caniglia&lt;/em&gt;, we reaffirmed &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt; even as we rejected a broader “community caretaking” justification for warrantless home entries.  The police had gone to Edward Caniglia’s home after his wife reported that he was suicidal.  Caniglia spoke with the officers on his front porch and agreed to go to a hospital for psychiatric testing.  Then, once he had left, the officers went inside and took away two handguns he owned.  The lower courts approved the entry on the ground that the officers were performing “community caretaking functions.”  593 U. S., at 196.  But we declined to recognize such an “open-ended license” for law enforcement officers to enter private homes.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 199.  Citing &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;, we readily acknowledged that officers may enter a home to “render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury.”  593 U. S., at 198.  But such emergency conditions  were indeed necessary and, given the facts, the officers had never tried to defend their entry on that basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Montana Supreme Court’s opinion strayed from the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; rule that trio of decisions&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;sets out.  To begin with, the court’s use of “community caretaker” doctrine was ill-advised, given that &lt;em&gt;Caniglia&lt;/em&gt; contrasted “community caretaking” with “render[ing] emergency assistance” and concluded that the former cannot alone justify a warrantless home entry.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  The Montana court, to be sure, tried to reconcile its approach with &lt;em&gt;Caniglia &lt;/em&gt;by depicting its community-caretaker rule as allowing home entries only in emergencies.  See 553 P. 3d, at 991.  But using terminology that this Court&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has held misplaced in home-entry cases could serve only to confuse the issue.  And yet more fundamental, the emergency-aid test incorporated in Montana’s caretaker doctrine is different from the one adopted in &lt;em&gt;Brigham City.  &lt;/em&gt;As noted above, Montana’s test finds a home entry “reasonable” when an officer has “specific and articulable facts” from which to “suspect” that someone needs help.  553 P. 3d, at 991; see &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;, at 4.  That test’s language, as the dissenting justices noted, evokes the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; standard applying to brief, investigative street stops: “reasonable suspicion” based on “specific and articulable facts.”  &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Sokolow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/490/1"&gt;490 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 7 (1989); &lt;em&gt;Terry&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Ohio&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/392/1"&gt;392 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 21 (1968); 553 P. 3d, at 999 (McKinnon, J.).  But &lt;em&gt;Brigham City &lt;/em&gt;did not adopt &lt;em&gt;Terry&lt;/em&gt;’s reasonable-suspicion standard for home entries, as both the State of Montana and the United States as &lt;em&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/em&gt; acknowledge.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 56, 68–69, 80.  Rather, &lt;em&gt;Brigham City &lt;/em&gt;formulated its own standard for dealing with household emergencies—again, whether an officer has “an objectively reasonable basis for believing” that an occupant is seriously injured or imminently threatened with such harm.  547 U. S., at 400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Case, however, wants something more.  He recognizes that the &lt;em&gt;Brigham City &lt;/em&gt;test applies here, and that it has had  but one formulation: In describing and applying that standard, we have never used any different terms.  See Brief for Case 24.  But still, Case urges us now to understand the &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt; test as “sound[ing] in probable cause.”  Brief for Case&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;15, 24.  What the test really requires, Case contends, is that police officers “have probable cause to believe [an occupant is] seriously injured or imminently threatened with such injury.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 2.  Case reaches that conclusion based mainly on the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;’s recognition of the “sanctity of the home.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 29.  Given that special status, he argues, a home entry’s aid-giving, “noninvestigatory purpose” should make no difference: The same probable-cause principles used in deciding whether “criminal activity [is] afoot” should apply as well in “assessing the risk and gravity of an emergency.”  Reply Brief 1–2, 8, 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We decline Case’s invitation to put a new probable-cause spin onto &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;.  “[T]he probable-cause standard,” this Court has often stated, “is peculiarly related to criminal investigations.”  &lt;em&gt;Treasury Employees&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Von Raab&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/489/656"&gt;489 U. S. 656&lt;/a&gt;, 667 (1989) (quoting &lt;em&gt;Colorado&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Bertine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/479/367"&gt;479 U. S. 367&lt;/a&gt;, 371 (1987)).  The standard’s history is “rooted” in the “criminal investigatory context.”  &lt;em&gt;O’Connor&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Ortega&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/480/709"&gt;480 U. S. 709&lt;/a&gt;, 723 (1987) (plurality opinion); see &lt;em&gt;Henry&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/361/98"&gt;361 U. S. 98&lt;/a&gt;, 100–102 (1959).  And the standard has acquired meaning over time by virtue of that context, as judges have assessed, in case after case, the requisite likelihood of finding criminal contraband or evidence.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Illinois&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Gates&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/462/213"&gt;462 U. S. 213&lt;/a&gt;, 238–239 (1983).  The resulting body of law would fit awkwardly, if at all, in the non-criminal, non-investigatory setting at issue here.  So &lt;em&gt;Brigham City &lt;/em&gt;adopted a different approach.  Rather than strain to relate probable-cause decisions to emergency-aid situations, we asked simply whether an officer had “an objectively reasonable basis for believing” that his entry was direly needed to prevent or deal with serious harm.  547 U. S., at 400.  In adhering to that question, we respect as  ever the “first among equals” status the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; affords the home.  &lt;em&gt;Jardines&lt;/em&gt;, 569 U. S., at 6; see &lt;em&gt;Caniglia&lt;/em&gt;, 593 U. S., at 198–199.  And in that vein, we note that an emergency-aid entry provides no basis to search the premises beyond what is reasonably needed to deal with the emergency while maintaining the officers’ safety.  But we assess the reasonableness of that limited entry on its own terms, rather than through the lens generally used to consider investigative activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Doing so here yields a ready conclusion: The officers had, as &lt;em&gt;Brigham City &lt;/em&gt;requires, an “objectively reasonable basis for believing” that their intervention was needed to prevent serious harm.  As earlier described, the officers knew first-hand that Case suffered from mental-health and alcohol-abuse problems, and that he had previously talked about committing suicide.  See &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;, at 2.  When they reached Case’s house, they learned about J. H. and Case’s just- concluded phone call—that Case, in an apparently inebriated state, threatened to kill himself, spoke of preparing a suicide note, and quite possibly cocked or even shot a gun before the line went dead.  The concerns that call raised were heightened by what the officers could see through the windows—empty beer cans, an empty holster, and a notepad—as well as by Case’s failure to respond to their urgent knocking.  If Case had already shot himself, he could have been severely injured and in need of immediate medical care.  And if he had not, the risk of suicide remained acute, given all the facts then known to the officers.  It was thus objectively reasonable for the police to believe that Case needed emergency aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Case counters that only the police entry itself created a “likely danger.”  Brief for Case 45.  His argument turns on the prospect of suicide-by-cop.  As noted earlier, Case had once before acted in a way seemingly designed to provoke a lethal police response, as the officers knew.  See &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;, at 2.  And J. H. told the officers that Case had threatened to  “shoot them all too” if they came to the scene.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  So the “main risk the officers objectively faced,” Case posits, was that “their very entry would induce” a shoot-out, leading to a “suicide-by-cop.”  Brief for Case 18.  And indeed, Case contends, the officers knew that: Why else would they have “waited roughly 40 minutes after their arrival” before entering his home?  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 43.  Case concludes that if the officers had only left well enough alone, nothing would have happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; But Case much oversimplifies a complex situation.  The objective reasonableness of an officer’s conduct under &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;, as in other &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; contexts, is evaluated by looking at the “totality of the circumstances.”  &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Barnes&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Felix&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/605/73"&gt;605 U. S. 73&lt;/a&gt;, 80 (2025); &lt;em&gt;Ohio&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Robinette&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/519/33"&gt;519 U. S. 33&lt;/a&gt;, 39 (1996).  One of those circumstances was no doubt that Case could provoke a confrontation.  As noted earlier, that was partly why the officers called the police chief to the scene and why they carefully considered protective measures—leading to some delay in their entry.  See &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;, at 2.  But there is no basis for thinking that the officers would have gone into Case’s home just so he could instigate a gunfight.  The circumstances making their entry reasonable, as just stated, were those suggesting that Case may already have shot himself or would do so absent intervention.  The statements Case made to J. H. plus the visual evidence corroborating them indicated that Case wanted to end his life.  The decision of the officers to enter his home to prevent that result—even at some significant risk to themselves—was (at the least) reasonable.  The &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; did not require them, as Case now argues, to leave him to his fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We repeat today what we have held before: An officer may enter a home without a warrant if he has “an objectively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant is seriously  injured or imminently threatened with such injury.”  &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;, 547 U. S., at 400.  The officers’ entry satisfied that test.  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment (even though not all the reasoning) of the Montana Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;It is so ordered&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;[January 14, 2026]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt;, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I join the Court’s opinion, which holds that police officers may enter a home without a warrant if they have an “ ‘objectively reasonable basis for believing’ ” that an occupant is seriously injured or imminently threatened with such harm.  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 5, 7, 10.  Although the Montana Supreme Court’s opinion appeared, erroneously, to apply a lower standard akin to reasonable suspicion, I agree that the officers here had an “ ‘objectively reasonable basis for believing’ ” that Case needed emergency assistance because he may have already shot himself or was imminently going to do so.  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 7–10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I write separately to underscore the unique considerations that law enforcement and courts should bear in mind when assessing whether there is an “objectively reasonable basis to believe” that a person experiencing a mental-health crisis needs law enforcement to “render emergency assistance.”  &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Stuart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/547/398"&gt;547 U. S. 398&lt;/a&gt;, 403 (2006).  As &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt; explained, the “ ‘justification for what would be otherwise’ ” an illegal warrantless entry of a home in this context is “ ‘[t]he need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;. (quoting &lt;em&gt;Mincey&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Arizona&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/437/385"&gt;437 U. S. 385&lt;/a&gt;, 392 (1978)).  The officers in &lt;em&gt;Brigham&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;City&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, needed to enter the house to break up an ongoing fight to protect a person whom they saw through a window being struck in the face and to prevent further violence.  547  U. S., at 406.  When an officer is called to respond to a person at risk of suicide, however, entering the house may not always be the objectively reasonable course of action to “ ‘preserve life or avoid serious injury.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 403 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Mincey&lt;/em&gt;, 437 U. S., at 392).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In these kinds of circumstances, the presence of law enforcement at times can escalate the situation rather that ameliorate it, putting both the occupant and the officers in danger.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Chamberlain&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;White Plains&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/960_F.3d_100"&gt;960 F. 3d 100&lt;/a&gt;, 101–104, 108 (CA2 2020) (officers repeatedly attempted entry of the home of a person with a known “history of mental illness,” eventually shooting and killing the occupant after he repeatedly said he was “ ‘okay’ ” and officers saw he did not need medical attention); &lt;em&gt;Bailey&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Kennedy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/349_F.3d_731"&gt;349 F. 3d 731&lt;/a&gt;, 734–736, 744 (CA4 2003) (officers attempted to enter house based on a neighbor’s report of suicide, eventually kicking and striking occupant to arrest him, despite occupant telling the officers that he was not suicidal and that they should leave).  The risk of escalation is also heightened by the prevalence of firearms in nearly half of American households.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Police may employ more forceful tactics when they know a firearm is in the house, and an occupant who is experiencing an acute mental-health crisis may react more unpredictably in response.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Corrigan&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;District of Columbia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/841_F.3d_1022"&gt;841 F. 3d 1022&lt;/a&gt;, 1025–1028 (CADC 2016) (despite occupant voluntarily meeting the police outside and disclaiming any intention to harm himself, the officers triggered occupant’s post- traumatic stress disorder after kicking his door and searching his house, based on report that he was suicidal and owned firearms); &lt;em&gt;Frazier&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Miller&lt;/em&gt;, 404 Mont. 1, 484 P. 3d 912, 916 (2021) (occupant initially told police he was “ ‘fine’ ” and to “go away” but drew pistol to his own head when the  officer continued to attempt entry, leading the officer to draw his gun in response and eventually shoot the occupant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Studies show that individuals with serious mental-health conditions are disproportionately likely to be injured and seven times more likely to be killed during police interactions compared to the general population.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  One report showed that over a 2-year period, “calls for help resulted in law enforcement officers shooting and killing the very people they were called on to assist” in 178 cases.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Another study found that police shooting incidents involving behavioral health concerns (suicidal behavior, substance use, or serious mental illness) were 2.1 times more likely to result in fatal injury than other police shooting incidents.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Further, individuals with a mental illness were “2.8 times more likely” to “be killed in their own homes” compared to those without a mental illness.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Given these risks, in some circumstances it may be more reasonable for officers to try different means of de-escalation before entering the home of a person experiencing a mental-health crisis.  Officers could, for example, attempt to speak with the occupant from a distance or over the phone; contact family, friends, or neighbors to help intervene; call in specialized police units, such as negotiators or  officers trained in crisis intervention;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or otherwise work with mental-health professionals to approach the occupant.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Officers called to respond to these kinds of situations should carefully investigate and assess the nature of the potential crisis and determine whether there is an objectively reasonable basis to believe that the occupant needs emergency aid inside before entering without a warrant.  Once the decision is made to enter, moreover, the “manner” of the officers’ entry and their subsequent conduct inside must also be “reasonable.”  &lt;em&gt;Brigham City&lt;/em&gt;, 547 U. S., at 406.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This case highlights the very complexities that will often attend emergency-aid interventions involving reported mental-health crises.  Multiple facts suggested that Case did not need emergency aid but was instead waiting inside for the officers in order to provoke a confrontation that would result in “suicide-by-cop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Case had told his girlfriend, J. H., on the phone that he would “shoot them all” if she called the police to his house.  App. 69.  Once J. H. arrived at the house, she told the officers that Case threatened to “shoot it out” with the police.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 70–74.  The officers also knew that in a prior incident in which police were called to respond to a suicide attempt by Case, Case had confronted the police in a way that suggested he was attempting suicide-by-cop.  Then, while surveying the house, the officers discussed how Case had “ ‘tried suicide by cop before’ ” and that it was likely Case  was “ ‘going to pull a gun on us’ ” once they “ ‘go in the house.’ ”  417 Mont. 354, 373, 553 P. 3d 985, 998 (2024).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; These facts, taken together, suggested that Case was neither already injured nor about to injure himself, but rather that the primary danger he faced would arise only if the officers entered his house.  In other words, these facts tended to undermine the officers’ basis to believe that he needed emergency assistance inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The officers’ warrantless entry ultimately did not violate the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, however, because there were sufficient facts on the other side of the ledger supporting an objectively reasonable basis to believe that Case had shot himself.  Critically, Case had told J. H. he had a “loaded gun” and J. H. heard a “clicking” sound like the “cock[ing]” of “a gun,” a “pop,” and then “just dead air” despite J. H. yelling Case’s name multiple times over the phone.  App. 68–69; 417 Mont., at 357, 553 P. 3d, at 988.  Case also told J. H. that he was “going to get a note” and “kill himself.”  App. 67–68.  When the officers arrived, they saw an empty handgun holster and notepad with writing inside Case’s house, and Case did not respond when they shouted his name into an open window.  Considered together, those facts gave rise to an objectively reasonable basis for the officers to believe that Case was already injured and in need of emergency medical assistance, and was not necessarily waiting inside for the officers seeking to provoke an escalation leading to suicide-by-cop.  As a result, the officers did not violate the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; when they entered Case’s home.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; That conclusion, on the facts of this case, does not mean it will always be objectively reasonable for officers responding to a mental-health crisis to make a warrantless entry.   A different mix of information might have led to the conclusion that the officers’ entry itself would put the occupant (and officers) at a greater risk of escalation and serious injury.  Because the “objectively reasonable basis” test, as reaffirmed by the Court today, demands careful attention to the case-specific risks that attend mental-health crises, and requires officers to act reasonably in response, I join the Court’s opinion in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-7ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;  Many jurisdictions around the country have introduced programs in which police officers and mental-health professionals jointly respond to calls about mental-health crises.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-8ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;  Case has not challenged the reasonableness of the officers’ manner of entry or their conduct inside his house after entry.

&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on writ of certiorari to the supreme court  of montana&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[January 14, 2026]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt;, concurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Today’s case, like another before it, holds that police officers generally do not violate a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; rights when they enter his house without a warrant, but with an “ ‘objectively reasonable basis’ ” for believing someone inside is in physical danger and in need of immediate aid.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 7 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Brigham City &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Stuart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/547/398"&gt;547 U. S. 398&lt;/a&gt;, 400 (2006)).  Importantly, the Court observes, this exception to the warrant requirement permits entry only to the extent reasonably necessary to address the apparent emergency and does not authorize officers to search a home more broadly.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 9.  With all that, I agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; But to me, a question lingers:  Why?  Does the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; tolerate this limited emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement just because five or more Justices of this Court happen to believe that such entries are “reasonable”?  Or is this exception more directly “tied to the law”?  &lt;em&gt;Carpenter&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/296"&gt;585 U. S. 296&lt;/a&gt;, 397 (2018) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch, J.&lt;/span&gt;, dissenting).  The answer, I believe, is the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; From before the founding through the present day, the common law has generally permitted a private citizen to enter another’s house and property in order to avert serious physical harm.  In those circumstances, and many others, courts have historically held that property rights give way to concern for human safety.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., 37 Hen. 6, pl. 26;&lt;em&gt; Mouse’s Case&lt;/em&gt;, 12 Co. Rep. 63, 77 Eng. Rep. 1341 (K. B. 1608);&lt;em&gt; Respublica&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Sparhawk&lt;/em&gt;, 1 Dall. 357, 363 (Pa. 1788); &lt;em&gt;Ploof &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Putnam&lt;/em&gt;, 81 Vt. 471, 474–475, 71 A. 188, 189 (1908).  Courts have long described property-law necessity defenses like these as turning, too, on the adequacy of the defendant’s judgment, not a &lt;em&gt;post-hoc&lt;/em&gt; assessment of necessity in fact.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Mitchell&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Harmony&lt;/em&gt;, 13 How. 115, 134–135 (1852); &lt;em&gt;Stone &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Mayor of City of New York&lt;/em&gt;, 25 Wend. 157, 176 (N. Y. 1840) (opinion of Verplanck, Sen.); &lt;em&gt;Surocco &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Geary&lt;/em&gt;, 3 Cal. 69, 72 (1853).&lt;a href="#CONCUR_6-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The common-law emergency rule is now often summarized this way:  “One is privileged to enter or remain on land in the possession of another if it is or reasonably appears to be necessary to prevent serious harm to . . . the actor[,] . . . the other[,] or a third person . . . unless the actor knows or has reason to know that the one for whose benefit he enters is unwilling that he shall take such action.”  Restatement (Second) of Torts §197(1) (1963–1964).  But, of course, this privilege comes with its logical limitations.  So, for example, a private citizen who enters a home to render emergency aid lacks license to do so in a manner “which a reasonable man would not regard as necessary to” address the apparent emergency.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., §214, and Comment &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;; see also &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., §197, Comment &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Des Moines &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Webster&lt;/em&gt;, 861 N. W. 2d 878, 883–885 (Iowa App. 2014); &lt;em&gt;State &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Lukus&lt;/em&gt;, 149 Mont. 45, 50–51, 423 P. 2d 49, 52–53 (1967).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Today’s decision echoes both the common-law emergency aid rule and its limitations.  It does so, to be sure, in the context of a law enforcement officer, not a private citizen, who sought to enter another’s home.  But on this point as well the common law has spoken, long providing that officers generally enjoy the same legal privileges as private citizens.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Entick &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Carrington&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;19 How. St. Tr. 1029, 1066 (C. P. 1765); 1 J. Chitty, Criminal Law 36 (1819); 2 M. Hale, Historia Placitorum Coronae 91 (1736).  And, reflecting the common law here again, this Court has held that the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; usually permits officers lacking a valid warrant to “take actions that any private citizen might do without fear of liability.”  &lt;em&gt;Caniglia&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Strom&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/593/194"&gt;593 U. S. 194&lt;/a&gt;, 198 (2021) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But they normally may do “no more” than that.  &lt;em&gt;Kentucky&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;King&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/563/452"&gt;563 U. S. 452&lt;/a&gt;, 469 (2011); see also &lt;em&gt;Entick&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;19 How. St. Tr., at 1066.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; It should come as no surprise that our decision today might accord with the accumulated learning of the common law—just as it should come as no surprise that our application of the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; ought to be informed by the common law’s lessons rather than mere intuition.  For a period, to be sure, the miasma created by this Court’s &lt;em&gt;Katz &lt;/em&gt;era led some to think the scope of the rights guaranteed by the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; depend on nothing more than current judicial instincts about “reasonable expectations of privacy.”  See &lt;em&gt;Carpenter&lt;/em&gt;, 585 U. S., at 394–395, 405–406 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch, J.&lt;/span&gt;, dissenting).  But that confusion cannot last forever, for no one should think the rights of Americans hang on so thin a thread.  Instead, and as Justice Story recognized, the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; is made of sturdier stuff, representing “the affirmance of a great constitutional doctrine of the common law.”  3 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 748 (1833).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_6-1ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; *Contrary to Mr. Case’s argument, &lt;em&gt;King &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Coate&lt;/em&gt;, Lofft. 73, 98 Eng. Rep. 539 (K. B. 1772), does not establish that the common law demanded an exacting showing of actual necessity to defeat a claim for trespass.  True, Lord Mansfield explained that any necessity defense in that case would need to “stand the strictest test,” with the “necessity manifestly proved.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 75, 98 Eng. Rep., at 540.  But &lt;em&gt;Coate&lt;/em&gt; involved an effort to involuntarily “confin[e] a person in a madhouse” for two months, not a claim over a home entry.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 74, 98 Eng. Rep., at 539.  And it is hardly surprising that the common law would demand a good deal more to justify a serious deprivation of liberty than to excuse an invasion of property rights aimed at protecting human safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 24–568. Argued October 8, 2025—Decided January 14, 2026&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Illinois law requires election officials to count mail-in ballots postmarked or certified no later than election day and received within two weeks of election day.  Congressman Michael Bost and two other political candidates filed a lawsuit claiming that counting ballots received after election day violates federal law.  They principally contended that doing so conflicts with &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/7"&gt;2 U. S. C. §7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/1"&gt;3 U. S. C. §1&lt;/a&gt;, which set election day as the Tuesday following the first Monday in November.  The district court dismissed the case, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed on the ground that petitioners lacked standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Held&lt;/em&gt;: As a candidate for office, Congressman Bost has standing to challenge the rules that govern the counting of votes in his election.  Pp. 3–10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; (a) Under Article III of the Constitution, plaintiffs must have a “personal stake” in a case to have standing to sue.  &lt;em&gt;FDA&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/367"&gt;602 U. S. 367&lt;/a&gt;, 379.  An unlawful election rule can injure a candidate in several ways: It might cause him to lose the election, require him to expend additional resources, or decrease his vote share and damage his reputation.  But winning, and doing so as inexpensively and decisively as possible, are not a candidate’s only interests in an election.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Candidates also have an interest in a fair process.  Candidates seek to represent the people, and their interest in that prize cannot be severed from their interest in the electoral process.  Win or lose, candidates suffer when the process departs from the law.  The harm to candidates from an unfair and inaccurate election is not common to all.   While voters also have a general interest in an accurate vote tally, a candidate’s interest differs in kind.  Those who spend time and resources seeking to claim the right to voice the will of the people have “an undeniably different—and more particularized—interest” in knowing what that will is.  &lt;em&gt;Hotze&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hudspeth&lt;/em&gt;, 16 F. 4th 1121, 1126 (Oldham, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Rules that undermine the integrity of the electoral process also undermine the winner’s political legitimacy.  The counting of unlawful votes—or discarding of lawful ones—erodes public confidence in election results and the elected representative.  “[R]eputational harms” are classic Article III injuries.  &lt;em&gt;TransUnion LLC&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Ramirez&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/413"&gt;594 U. S. 413&lt;/a&gt;, 425.  And they are particularly concrete for those whose very jobs depend on the support of the people.  Pp. 3–6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; (b) Candidates do not need to show a substantial risk that a rule will cause them to lose the election or prevent them from achieving a legally significant vote threshold in order to have standing.  Requiring such a showing could channel many election disputes to shortly before election day or after.  Only then will many candidates be able to predict with any certainty that a rule will be outcome determinative.  Yet the Court has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election.   Such late-breaking, court-ordered rule changes can result in voter confusion and undermine confidence in the integrity of electoral processes.  The democratic consequences can be worse if courts intervene only after votes have been counted.  Counting first and ruling upon legality afterwards is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Premising standing on a candidate’s risk of election loss or failure to achieve a certain vote threshold would also convert Article III judges into political prognosticators and “invite[ ] findings on matters as to which neither judges nor anyone else can have any confidence.”  &lt;em&gt;Rucho&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Common Cause&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/684"&gt;588 U. S. 684&lt;/a&gt;, 711 (internal quotation marks omitted).  “[A]ccurately predicting electoral outcomes is not” a “simple” endeavor.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 712.  And the limits of federal courts’ jurisdiction do not rest upon such “unstable ground outside judicial expertise.”  &lt;em&gt;Id., &lt;/em&gt;at 713.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Nor would requiring candidates to plead a substantial risk of harm to their vote share leave courts on any surer footing.  Such an approach would force judges to assess whether an election rule is likely to disadvantage a particular candidate—determinations judges are no better qualified to make than assessing a candidate’s likelihood of winning or losing.  Candidates would also have to plead and prove that voters who take advantage of the challenged rule will favor their rivals, which may require divulging information about political vulnerabilities.   Faced with that prospect, many candidates are sure to wait until after votes are counted to sue.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Article III does not require this result.  Candidates have a concrete and particularized interest in the rules that govern the counting of votes in their elections, regardless whether those rules harm their electoral prospects or increase the cost of their campaigns.  Their interest extends to the integrity of the election—and the democratic process by which they earn or lose the support of the people they seek to represent.  Pp. 6–10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;114 F. 4th 634, reversed and remanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;MICHAEL J. BOST, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al.&lt;/span&gt;, PETITIONERS &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; ILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[January 14, 2026]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Chief Justice Roberts&lt;/span&gt; delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Three political candidates challenged Illinois’s procedure for counting mail-in ballots received after election day.  We consider whether the candidates have standing to maintain their suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Illinois law requires election officials to count mail-in ballots postmarked or certified no later than election day and received within two weeks of election day.  Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 10, §§5/19–8(c), 5/18A–15(a) (West 2022).  In May 2022, Congressman Michael Bost and Presidential elector nominees Laura Pollastrini and Susan Sweeney (petitioners) sued the Illinois State Board of Elections and its executive director (respondents), claiming that counting ballots received after election day violates federal law.  They principally contended that doing so conflicts with &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/7"&gt;2 U. S. C. §7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/1"&gt;3 U. S. C. §1&lt;/a&gt;, which set election day as the Tuesday following the first Monday in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  In their complaint and declarations, petitioners asserted several bases for standing as candidates.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  They first argued that they were “entitled to have their election[ ] results certified with votes received in compliance with the federal Election Day statutes.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 87a.  And they alleged that they “rely on provisions of federal and state law in conducting their campaigns including, in particular, resources allocated to the post-election certification process.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 87a–88a.  Congressman Bost further explained that the late counting of ballots would require him to “organize, fundraise, and run [his] campaign for fourteen additional days.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 66a.  This, in turn, would “cost[ his] campaign time, money, volunteers and other resources” by, for example, requiring the campaign to send poll watchers to “monitor late arriving ballots.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 67a.  He also alleged that he “risk[ed] injury if untimely and illegal ballots cause[d him] to lose [his] election,” and “because [his] margin of victory . . . may be reduced.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 68a.  “A diminished margin of victory [would] lead to the public perception that [his] constituents have concerns about [his] job performance,” which would “influence . . . future voters, Congressional leadership, donors, and potential political opponents.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 68a–69a.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The District Court held that petitioners lacked standing and dismissed the suit.  684 F. Supp. 3d 720 (ND Ill. 2023).  Petitioners appealed, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  114 F. 4th 634 (2024).  The court concluded that the costs to monitor vote counting after election day could not support standing, because those costs would have been voluntarily incurred “to avoid a hypothetical future harm—an election defeat.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 642.  In doing so, the court noted that Congressman Bost had won the last election with 75% of the vote.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  It also rejected petitioners’ asserted “ ‘competitive injury,’ ” reasoning that they “do not (and cannot) allege that the majority of the votes that will be received and counted after Election Day will break against them.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 643.  Finally, it dismissed petitioners’ asserted injury based on an inaccurate vote tally as unduly “speculative,” because “the election is months away and the voting process has not even started.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 644.  Judge Scudder dissented in part.  In his view, Congressman Bost had standing based on the extra costs his campaign would incur to monitor the counting of late arriving ballots.  We granted certiorari.  605 U. S. ___ (2025). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Under Article III of the Constitution, plaintiffs must have a “personal stake” in a case to have standing to sue.  &lt;em&gt;FDA&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/367"&gt;602 U. S. 367&lt;/a&gt;, 379 (2024).  They must, in other words, be able to answer a basic question: “ ‘What’s it to you?’ ”  A. Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 881, 882 (1983).  Congressman Bost has an obvious answer: He is a candidate for office.  And a candidate has a personal stake in the rules that govern the counting of votes in his election.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; An unlawful election rule can injure a candidate in several ways.  It might cause him to lose the election.  It might require him to expend additional resources.  Or it might decrease his vote share and damage his reputation.  Respondents concede that each of these harms can be legally cognizable.  But they contend that Congressman Bost failed to adequately plead any such harm here.  We need not resolve whether respondents are right, because winning, and doing so as inexpensively and decisively as possible, are not a candidate’s only interests in an election.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; To start, candidates also have an interest in a fair process.  Candidates are not common competitors in the economic marketplace.  They seek to represent the people.  And their interest in that prize cannot be severed from their interest in the electoral process—a process “of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure.”  &lt;em&gt;Illinois Bd. of Elections&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Socialist Workers Party&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/440/173"&gt;440 U. S. 173&lt;/a&gt;, 184 (1979).  Win or lose, candidates suffer when the process departs from the law.  Thus, the long-shot and shoo-in alike would suffer harm if a State chose to conduct its election by, say, flipping a coin.  The result of such an election would not reflect the will of the people, and the candidates would lose the opportunity to compete for the people’s support.  So too, similar harms would result from less dramatic departures—for example, if a State decided to discard a random 10% of cast votes.  Whether these decisions help, hurt, or have no effect on a candidate’s electoral prospects, they deprive the candidate of a fair process and an accurate result.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Such harm to candidates is in no sense “common to all members of the public.”  &lt;em&gt;Lance&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Coffman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/549/437"&gt;549 U. S. 437&lt;/a&gt;, 440 (2007) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Voters, to be sure, also have a “general interest” in an accurate vote tally.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;. (internal quotation marks omitted).  But a candidate’s interest differs in kind.  An unfair and inaccurate election plainly affects those who compete for the support of the people in a different way than it affects the people who lend their support.  We have no occasion to theorize about the “significance of the[se] relative interests,” contra, &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 3 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Jackson&lt;/span&gt;, J., dissenting), or the “sincer[ity]” with which they are held, &lt;em&gt;Carney&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Adams&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/592/53"&gt;592 U. S. 53&lt;/a&gt;, 59 (2020) (internal quotation marks omitted).  What matters is that the harm candidates suffer is distinct from that suffered by the “people generally.”  &lt;em&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Mellon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/262/447"&gt;262 U. S. 447&lt;/a&gt;, 488 (1923).  Those who spend untold time and resources seeking to claim the right to voice the will of the people have “an undeniably different—and more particularized—interest” in knowing what that will is.  &lt;em&gt;Hotze&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hudspeth&lt;/em&gt;, 16 F. 4th 1121, 1126 (CA5 2021) (Oldham, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Rules that undermine the “integrity of the electoral process” also undermine the winner’s political legitimacy.  &lt;em&gt;Crawford&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Marion County Election Bd.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/553/181"&gt;553 U. S. 181&lt;/a&gt;, 197 (2008) (opinion of Stevens, J.).  The counting of unlawful votes—or discarding of lawful ones—erodes public confidence that the election results reflect the people’s will.  And when public confidence in the election results falters, public confidence in the elected representative follows.  To the representative, that loss of legitimacy—or its diminution—is a concrete harm.  “[R]eputational harms,” as a general matter, are classic Article III injuries.  &lt;em&gt;TransUnion LLC&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Ramirez&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/413"&gt;594 U. S. 413&lt;/a&gt;, 425 (2021) (citing &lt;em&gt;Meese&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Keene&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/481/465"&gt;481 U. S. 465&lt;/a&gt;, 473 (1987)).  But they are particularly concrete for those whose very jobs depend on the support of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Candidates, in short, are not “mere bystanders” in their own elections.  &lt;em&gt;Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;EPA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/606/100"&gt;606 U. S. 100&lt;/a&gt;, 110 (2025).  They have an obvious personal stake in how the result is determined and regarded.  Departures from the preordained rules cause them particularized and concrete harm.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  The same is true of competitors in other contests.  Each runner in a 100-meter dash, for example, would suffer if the race were unexpectedly extended to 105 meters.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 90.  Whether a particular runner expects to finish strong or fall off the pace in the final five meters, all would be deprived of the chance to compete for the prize that the rules define.  The fastest to run 105 meters has not won the 100-meter dash.  And in much the same way, an unlawful extension of vote counting deprives candidates of the opportunity to compete for election under the Constitution and laws of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Respondents and the dissent dismiss these harms, which plainly affect candidates in a “personal and individual way,” as generalized grievances.  &lt;em&gt;Spokeo, Inc.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Robins&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/578/330"&gt;578 U. S. 330&lt;/a&gt;, 339 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And they suggest that in order to have standing, plaintiff-candidates must show some substantial risk that a rule will cause them to lose the election, prevent them from achieving a legally significant vote threshold, or damage their reputation or finances.  Brief for Respondents 25–26; &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 9.  That approach finds no support in Article III’s case or controversy requirement or our case law interpreting that requirement.  And it is as practically untenable as it is undemocratic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Premising standing on a candidate’s risk of election loss or failure to achieve a certain vote threshold could channel many election disputes to shortly before election day—or worse, after.  Only then will many candidates be able to predict with any certainty that a rule will be outcome determinative.  And only then will they be able to produce the “manner and degree of evidence required,” particularly at later “stages of the litigation,” to establish standing.  &lt;em&gt;Lujan&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Defenders of Wildlife&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/504/555"&gt;504 U. S. 555&lt;/a&gt;, 561 (1992).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Yet “[t]his Court has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election.”  &lt;em&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Democratic National Committee&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/589/423"&gt;589 U. S. 423&lt;/a&gt;, 424 (2020) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).  Such late-breaking, court-ordered rule changes can “result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls,” and thus undermine the “[c]onfidence in the integrity of our electoral processes . . . essential to the functioning of our participatory democracy.”  &lt;em&gt;Purcell&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Gonzalez&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/549/1"&gt;549 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 4–5 (2006) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;); see also &lt;em&gt;Republican Party of Pennsylvania&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Degraffenreid&lt;/em&gt;, 592 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2021) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas&lt;/span&gt;, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 4–5).  The democratic consequences can be even more dire if courts intervene only after votes have been counted.  “Count first, and rule upon legality afterwards, is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires.”  &lt;em&gt;Bush&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Gore&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/531/1046"&gt;531 U. S. 1046&lt;/a&gt;, 1047 (2000) (Scalia, J., concurring in grant of stay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Even if some candidates could muster evidence well before election day that a rule will likely be outcome determinative, respondents’ and the dissent’s approach would convert Article III judges into political prognosticators and “invite[ ] findings on matters as to which neither judges nor anyone else can have any confidence.”  &lt;em&gt;Rucho&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Common Cause&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/684"&gt;588 U. S. 684&lt;/a&gt;, 711 (2019) (internal quotation marks omitted).  As a number of prominent historical figures can attest, not least among them Charles Evans Hughes and Thomas Dewey, “accurately predicting electoral outcomes is not” a “simple” endeavor.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 712.  And if the prognosticators themselves lack the “political clairvoyance” to predict the winner &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; all votes have been cast, then surely judges are poorly positioned to assess whether a candidate’s risk of loss, months earlier, is substantial.  &lt;em&gt;Diamond Alternative Energy&lt;/em&gt;, 606 U. S., at 123; see also &lt;em&gt;Vieth&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Jubelirer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/541/267"&gt;541 U. S. 267&lt;/a&gt;, 287, n. 8 (2004) (plurality opinion).  The limits of federal courts’ jurisdiction do not rest upon such “unstable ground outside judicial expertise.”  &lt;em&gt;Rucho&lt;/em&gt;, 588 U. S., at 713.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Nor would requiring candidates to plead a substantial risk of harm to their vote share leave courts on any surer footing.  Such an approach would force judges to assess whether an election rule is likely to disadvantage a particular candidate.  And at least as respondents suggest, judges must then also ensure that any disadvantage is linked to reputational or financial harm.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Judges are no better qualified to make such determinations than they are to assess a candidate’s likelihood of winning or losing.  Even if they could do so, this approach would still channel many disputes into postelection litigation.  To bring a preelection suit, a candidate would have to plead and prove that voters who take advantage of the challenged rule will favor his rivals.  Doing so while campaigning for those same voters’ support is not just awkward, but politically dangerous.  Particularly for new election rules, it may require divulging information about vulnerabilities that rival candidates could exploit.  Faced with that prospect, many candidates are sure to wait until after votes are counted to sue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Adding monetary harm to the equation, as the concurrence proposes, would change none of this.  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 2–3 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Barrett&lt;/span&gt;, J., concurring in judgment).  Plaintiffs cannot “manufacture standing by voluntarily” incurring costs.  &lt;em&gt;Federal Election Comm’n&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Ted Cruz for Senate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/289"&gt;596 U. S. 289&lt;/a&gt;, 297 (2022).  They must incur those costs to  “mitigate or avoid” a “ ‘substantial risk’ ” of some independent harm.  &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Amnesty Int’l USA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/398"&gt;568 U. S. 398&lt;/a&gt;, 414, n. 5 (2013).  Acknowledging as much, the concurrence ultimately speculates that it is “reasonably probable” Congressman Bost’s election will be at risk because of discrepancies in late-arriving ballots.  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 3.  Such conjecture—beyond finding little support in the pleadings—carries all the concerns we have explained.  And the concurrence’s approach introduces a new one: Apparently, a candidate who pays poll watchers a penny would have standing, while one who relies on volunteers would not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Nothing about Article III requires this result.  Candidates have a concrete and particularized interest in the rules that govern the counting of votes in their elections, regardless whether those rules harm their electoral prospects or increase the cost of their campaigns.  Their interest extends to the integrity of the election—and the &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;democratic process by which they earn or lose the support of the people they seek to represent.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; text-align: justify;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “Courts sometimes make standing law more complicated than it needs to be.”  &lt;em&gt;Thole &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; U. S. Bank N. A.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/590/538"&gt;590 U. S. 538&lt;/a&gt;, 547 (2020).  We decline respondents’ invitation to do so here.  As a candidate for office, Congressman Bost has standing to challenge the rules that govern the counting of votes in his election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-1ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;  At the time, Congressman Bost was a candidate in the 2022 election, and Pollastrini and Sweeney planned to seek reappointment as Presidential electors in the 2024 election.  Congressman Bost has served as the United States Representative for Illinois’s 12th Congressional District since he was first elected in 2014.  And he was previously a member of the Illinois House of Representatives, to which he was first elected in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-2ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  Petitioners also alleged that Illinois’s ballot receipt deadline injured them as voters by “dilut[ing] the weight of [their] votes.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 88a.  They have not advanced that argument before this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  Because only one plaintiff needs standing for a suit to proceed, we do not address whether Pollastrini and Sweeney have standing to sue as prospective Presidential electors.  See &lt;em&gt;Biden &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Nebraska&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/600/477"&gt;600 U. S. 477&lt;/a&gt;, 489 (2023).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-4ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;  Respondents do not dispute that Congressman Bost &lt;em&gt;pleaded&lt;/em&gt; a distinct interest in the “election[ ] results [being] certified with [lawful] votes.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 87a.  They argue only that this interest is not legally cognizable. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Because we disagree, we need not resolve the parties’ pleading dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-5ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;  Contrary to the concurrence’s suggestion, &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 4 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Barrett&lt;/span&gt;, J., concurring in judgment), such harm is far “more particularized and more concrete than the mere assertion that something unlawful benefited [a] competitor.”  &lt;em&gt;Already, LLC&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Nike, Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/85"&gt;568 U. S. 85&lt;/a&gt;, 99 (2013).  And it  bears little resemblance to the specific injury alleged in &lt;em&gt;Already&lt;/em&gt;: a risk of being sued by a company that had issued an “unconditional and irrevocable” covenant not to sue.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 93.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-6ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  Respondents at times appear to suggest that “[a] candidate may have standing if she demonstrates that an election rule disadvantages her relative to a competitor,” even absent proof of reputational or financial harm or a risk that she will lose the election.  Brief for Respondents 26; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 94.  Yet it is far from clear why a slight but certain competitive disadvantage would qualify as an injury in fact but requiring a candidate to compete in an unfair election would not.  Indeed, the harm a candidate would suffer from winning 60% of the vote, instead of 61%, seems less salient than the harm she would suffer if she instead won 62% because of an unlawful rule, and the public believed she had received an unfair advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-7ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;  We do not share the dissent’s concern that our recognition of this commonsense reality will “open[ ] the floodgates” to candidate-led challenges to ballot “format.”  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 11–12.  Indeed, the dissent itself suggests that courts already “ ‘often decide ballot-design cases,’ ” pointing to a case in which a court concluded that candidates &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have standing to challenge “ ‘the form of election ballots.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 12, n. 5 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Kim &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Hanlon&lt;/em&gt;, 99 F. 4th 140, 147, 153 (CA3 2024)).  To the extent the dissent’s concern is that federal courts will be inundated with more trivial “format” challenges, &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 12, to things like “ballot font and typeface,” Brief for District of Columbia et al. as &lt;em&gt;Amici Curiae&lt;/em&gt; 20, it is neither clear why candidates would waste their resources in this way nor on what basis in federal law such suits could be brought.  In any event, we address today only candidates’ standing to challenge rules that, like Illinois’s, govern the counting of votes in their elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[January 14, 2026]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Barrett&lt;/span&gt;, with whom &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Kagan&lt;/span&gt; joins, concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; While I agree with the Court that Congressman Bost has standing, I disagree with its reasoning.  In my view, Congressman Bost has standing because he has suffered a traditional pocketbook injury, not because of his status as a candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Constitution limits federal courts to deciding “Cases” and “Controversies.”  Art. III, §2.  To satisfy this requirement, a plaintiff must show (among other things) that he has suffered an actual injury—put colloquially, he must be able to answer the basic question “ ‘What’s it to you?’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 3.  We give content to that maxim by requiring a plaintiff to show a “concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent” injury.  &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Amnesty Int’l USA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/398"&gt;568 U. S. 398&lt;/a&gt;, 409 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A “particularized” injury is a harm affecting a plaintiff “in a personal and individual way,” not a “generalized grievance” shared by the public.  &lt;em&gt;Spokeo, Inc&lt;/em&gt;. v. &lt;em&gt;Robins&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/578/330"&gt;578 U. S. 330&lt;/a&gt;, 339, and n. 7 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A “concrete” injury is a nonabstract harm of the type “that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 340–341.  And an “actual  or imminent” injury is one that is “certainly impending” rather than “speculative.”  &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt;, 568 U. S., at 401.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; A plaintiff must establish standing at the time of filing and maintain it throughout litigation.  &lt;em&gt;Carney&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Adams&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/592/53"&gt;592 U. S. 53&lt;/a&gt;, 59 (2020).  He must support each element of standing “with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  &lt;em&gt;Lujan&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Defenders of Wildlife&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/504/555"&gt;504 U. S. 555&lt;/a&gt;, 561 (1992).  At the pleading stage, “general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may suffice.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.; see &lt;em&gt;Spokeo&lt;/em&gt;, 578 U. S., at 338 (a complaint must “ ‘clearly . . . allege facts demonstrating’ ” standing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Pocketbook harm is a traditional Article III injury.  &lt;em&gt;Tyler &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Hennepin&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;County&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/631"&gt;598 U. S. 631&lt;/a&gt;, 636 (2023).  That is so not only when a law directly imposes costs on a plaintiff, see, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;McGowan &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Maryland&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/366/420"&gt;366 U. S. 420&lt;/a&gt;, 430–431 (1961) (profits lost from Sunday-closing law), but also when a plaintiff “reasonably incur[s] costs to mitigate or avoid” the “ ‘substantial risk’ ” of a harm caused by a statute, &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt;, 568 U. S., at 414, n. 5 (collecting cases).  For instance, in &lt;em&gt;Monsanto Co.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Geertson Seed Farms&lt;/em&gt;, farmers of conventional alfalfa sought injunctive relief against a rule deregulating (and thus permitting) the planting of genetically modified alfalfa.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/561/139"&gt;561 U. S. 139&lt;/a&gt;, 153–154 (2010).  The farmers “established a reasonable probability that their organic and conventional alfalfa crops will be infected with the engineered gene” through cross-contamination.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 153 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And because the farmers took costly preventative measures to “minimize the likelihood of potential contamination,” they suffered an Article III injury.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 154–155; see also &lt;em&gt;Virginia&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;American Booksellers Assn., Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/484/383"&gt;484 U. S. 383&lt;/a&gt;, 392 (1988) (finding standing where regulated booksellers must incur compliance costs or risk prosecution).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Like the farmers in &lt;em&gt;Monsanto&lt;/em&gt;, Congressman Bost alleges that he will “reasonably incur costs to mitigate or avoid” the  “ ‘substantial risk’ ” of harm caused by the challenged statute.  &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt;, 568 U. S., at 414, n. 5.  He claims that Illinois’s ballot-receipt deadline will increase the number of late-arriving ballots, which often “have discrepancies (e.g., insufficient information, missing signatures, dates, or postmarks) that need to be resolved.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.  Invalid ballots, he says, will put his election at risk and damage his reputation.  To avoid these reasonably probable harms, his campaign “has spent, and will spend, money, time, and resources to monitor and respond as needed to ballots received by state election officials after the national Election Day.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 65a.  If poll watchers are not present to monitor ballot counting, county officials could “accep[t] possibly deficient ballots in bulk.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 67a.  Accordingly, it is standard practice for campaigns to send poll watchers to monitor ballot counting to ensure that any discrepancies are resolved appropriately.  See Brief for League of Women Voters et al. as &lt;em&gt;Amici Curiae&lt;/em&gt; 20 (calling it “political malpractice” for candidates not to monitor ballot counting in their races).  Because Congressman Bost’s expenditures mitigate a substantial risk of harm, he has pleaded Article III injury.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Rather than take this straightforward path, the Court charts a novel one: To challenge “the rules that govern the counting of votes in his election,” a candidate need only allege that he is in fact a candidate in that election.  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 3.  The Court makes no attempt to demonstrate that the bare fact of facing changed vote-counting rules is a traditionally recognized harm.  See &lt;em&gt;TransUnion LLC &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Ramirez&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/413"&gt;594 U. S. 413&lt;/a&gt;, 424–425 (2021).  Nor does it grapple with &lt;em&gt;Already, LLC &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Nike, Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, which holds that a plaintiff cannot show an Article III injury by claiming only that an allegedly unlawful practice benefits a competitor without any showing of harm to himself.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/85"&gt;568 U. S. 85&lt;/a&gt;, 99 (2013).  By holding that a candidate always has an interest in challenging vote-counting rules, even if those rules do not impose a competitive disadvantage on him, the Court today relieves candidates of having to show any real harm.  See &lt;em&gt;ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 4.  Candidates are apparently entitled to this extraordinarily forgiving rule because they are “not common competitors in the economic marketplace.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I cannot join the Court’s creation of a bespoke standing rule for candidates.  Elections are important, but so are many things in life.  We have always held candidates to the same standards as any other litigant.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Davis &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Federal Election Comm’n&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/554/724"&gt;554 U. S. 724&lt;/a&gt;, 733–734 (2008) (applying ordinary standing analysis to candidate challenging financial disclosure requirements); &lt;em&gt;Wittman &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Personhuballah&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/578/539"&gt;578 U. S. 539&lt;/a&gt;, 545 (2016) (applying ordinary standing analysis to legislators running for reelection who challenged redistricting plan); &lt;em&gt;Carney&lt;/em&gt;, 592 U. S., at 59–60 (requiring a would-be candidate to show concrete intention to seek office to challenge partisan-balance rule).  And we have repeatedly rejected requests to create special standing rules for particular litigants.  See, &lt;em&gt;e.g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Raines &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Byrd&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/521/811"&gt;521 U. S. 811&lt;/a&gt;, 821, 830 (1997) (legislator standing); &lt;em&gt;Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Winn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/563/125"&gt;563 U. S. 125&lt;/a&gt;, 134 (2011) (taxpayer standing); &lt;em&gt;Lujan&lt;/em&gt;, 504 U. S., at 566–567 (animal-enthusiast standing); &lt;em&gt;FDA&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/367"&gt;602 U. S. 367&lt;/a&gt;, 392–393 (2024) (doctor standing).  I see no reason to afford candidates favored status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Nor do the practical realities of running for office warrant special treatment for candidates.  As Congressman Bost concedes, “candidates could probably articulate their injury  in terms of a pocketbook injury” “in many election law cases.”  Brief for Petitioners 21.  So in addition to being unmoored from precedent, the Court’s broader rule is unnecessary on Congressman Bost’s own telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We need not deviate from established standing principles to resolve this case in Congressman Bost’s favor.  I respectfully concur only in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;_________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;No. 24–568&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;_________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;MICHAEL J. BOST, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al.&lt;/span&gt;, PETITIONERS &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; ILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[January 14, 2026]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt;, with whom &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt; joins, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Under our standing precedents, this is an easy case.  Article III requires plaintiffs to assert and establish an “injury in fact”—&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;., the “invasion of a legally protected interest” that is both “concrete and particularized” and “actual or imminent.”  &lt;em&gt;Lujan&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Defenders of Wildlife&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/504/555"&gt;504 U. S. 555&lt;/a&gt;, 560 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Congressman Bost has failed to allege that the election-related law he seeks to challenge has caused him to suffer any injury that satisfies those requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; A majority of the Court nevertheless concludes that Bost has standing to sue based solely on his status as a candidate for office.  The Court thereby subtly shifts from our longstanding actual-injury rule to a presumption that certain kinds of plaintiffs are sufficiently aggrieved to satisfy Article III standing, regardless of whether they will experience any particularized harm.  In my view, this dubious departure from settled law disregards both the equal treatment of litigants and judicial restraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Barrett &lt;/span&gt;rightly rejects today’s bespoke candidate-standing rule.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4 (opinion concurring in judgment).  Yet her pocketbook theory would allow political candidates to spend their way past Article III’s injury-in-fact requirement, despite our clear admonition that  plaintiffs “cannot manufacture standing by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.”  &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Amnesty Int’l USA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/398"&gt;568 U. S. 398&lt;/a&gt;, 402 (2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In the end, I would not allow Bost’s suit to move forward on grounds that we have deemed insufficient to establish Article III standing for other plaintiffs.  Because I believe that political candidates can and should be held to the same actual-injury requirements as other litigants, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Any litigant who invokes the judicial power of the federal courts under Article III “must establish that he has a ‘personal stake’ in the alleged dispute, and that the alleged injury suffered is particularized as to him.”  &lt;em&gt;Raines&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Byrd&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/521/811"&gt;521 U. S. 811&lt;/a&gt;, 819 (1997).  Today, however, the Court essentially pronounces that this foundational principle no longer applies to candidates for elected office.  It declares that all candidates have standing to challenge election regulations in light of their interest in a “fair process.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4.  No matter that, in a democratic society like ours, the interest in a fair electoral process is common to all members of the voting public.  The Court thus ignores a core constitutional requirement while unnecessarily thrusting the Judiciary into the political arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The majority’s primary failing is its refusal to recognize that the alleged injury it identifies—the suffering that results from an unfair electoral process—is not particular to candidate-plaintiffs.  The importance of the particularity requirement cannot be overstated, for it is this requirement that “prevents the judicial process from becoming no more than a vehicle for the vindication of the value interests of concerned bystanders.”  &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/412/669"&gt;412 U. S. 669&lt;/a&gt;, 687 (1973).  Such a result is incompatible with our constitutional design, which recognizes that “ ‘abstract questions of wide public significance’ ” are “most appropriately addressed in the representative branches.”  &lt;em&gt;Valley Forge Christian College&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/454/464"&gt;454 U. S. 464&lt;/a&gt;, 475 (1982) (quoting &lt;em&gt;Warth&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Seldin&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/422/490"&gt;422 U. S. 490&lt;/a&gt;, 500 (1975)).  In other words, the particularity requirement ensures that the Judiciary stays in its proper lane, leaving to the people’s representatives the prerogative to decide questions of broad importance in the absence of a litigant with a “direct stake in the outcome.”  &lt;em&gt;Sierra Club&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Morton&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/405/727"&gt;405 U. S. 727&lt;/a&gt;, 740 (1972).  As such, litigants without a direct stake—&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;., those who assert no more than “generalized grievances about the conduct of government”—cannot satisfy the “case or controversy aspect of standing.”  &lt;em&gt;Valley Forge&lt;/em&gt;, 454 U. S., at 479 (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Today’s decision all but ignores the particularity requirement and the democracy-preserving function that it serves.  This case, the Court says, involves “[a]n unlawful election rule,” which necessarily injures candidates’ “interest in a fair process.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4.  But, even assuming that Illinois’s rule is unlawful (as we must for standing purposes), the Court makes no real attempt to explain how that injury is particular to candidates; to the contrary, it acknowledges that voters, too, have a stake in a fair electoral process.  See &lt;em&gt;ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 5.  Yet the Court insists that a candidate’s interest is “undeniably different” from that of a voter’s, because it is the candidate—and not the voter—who “compete[s]” in an election.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; That assessment gets the significance of the relative interests exactly backward.  A public office is a public trust, and an election for that office is the ultimate expression of the will of the people, not a mere competition to be won or lost.  In the Court’s telling, though, elections are a glorified  national pastime—the competitors’ success is the main objective, and voters are mere bystanders who simply “lend their support.” &lt;em&gt; Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  This depiction drastically devalues the role elections play in a democratic society.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Court similarly misrepresents the harm that occurs when unlawful election rules “erod[e] public confidence [in] the election results.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  To be sure, a tainted election can hurt a candidate if it undermines the public’s perception of that officeholder’s legitimacy and harms his reputation in the process (assuming he makes that allegation).&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  But voters suffer too—and arguably even more so—when their fellow citizens lose confidence in the results of an election.  Indeed, the same loss of faith the majority counts as injurious to candidates could be a fatal blow to the public’s interest in democratic governance.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Batting away these foundational truths, the Court finds “no occasion to theorize” about the relative significance of voters’ and candidates’ shared interest in free and fair elections.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  But it is the Court’s own analysis—&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;., its  purported distinction between the interests of candidates and voters in fair election outcomes—that raises the comparative question, not mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In any event, I agree that we need not “theorize” about the significance of these interests, for one thing is indisputably clear: Our democracy was founded on the “self-evident” truth that a government is legitimate only insofar as it derives its “just powers from the consent of the governed.”  Declaration of Independence ¶2.  Candidates come and go, but the voters’ collective interest in the “right to elect legislators in a free and unimpaired fashion” is enduring and indispensable.  &lt;em&gt;Reynolds&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Sims&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/377/533"&gt;377 U. S. 533&lt;/a&gt;, 562 (1964).  Against this backdrop, the Court’s effort to isolate and elevate a candidate’s “distinct” interest in electoral integrity, &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 5, falls flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For today’s standing purposes, the key realization is that, in a democracy, the (existential) interest in fair and accurate elections is common to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; members of the voting public.  I acknowledge that “[t]hose who spend untold time and resources seeking to claim the right to voice the will of the people,” &lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;—candidates—have a particularized interest &lt;em&gt;in getting the job&lt;/em&gt;.  That is precisely why candidates do have Article III standing if an unlawful election rule creates a substantial risk of harm to that interest (the risk of an election loss).  But when what is at stake is the overall fairness of the electoral process, it is the people’s shared interest in democracy itself (and not just the candidate’s job prospects) that hangs in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Court’s standing analysis elides all this by employing the commonsense intuition that, “[w]in or lose, candidates suffer when the process departs from the law.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4.  But how is that a particularized injury?  Anyone and everyone who is governed by law is similarly harmed by any departure from the law’s requirements.  Moreover, this Court  has repeatedly instructed that litigants “may not sue based only on an ‘asserted right to have the Government act in accordance with law.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;FDA&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/367"&gt;602 U. S. 367&lt;/a&gt;, 381 (2024) (quoting &lt;em&gt;Allen&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Wright&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/468/737"&gt;468 U. S. 737&lt;/a&gt;, 754 (1984)); see also &lt;em&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Mellon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/262/447"&gt;262 U. S. 447&lt;/a&gt;, 488 (1923) (rejecting theory that taxpayers have standing to challenge an allegedly unlawful government action requiring the use of public funds because “[t]he party who invokes the [judicial] power must be able to show . . . that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury. . . , and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Here, the generalized nature of the “fair process” harm is indisputable: If Illinois’s vote-count rule is unlawful, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; participants in the electoral process—not only candidates for office but also every voter who has cast a ballot in the election—would be deprived “of a fair process and an accurate result.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4.  But, as this Court has time and again explained, such an assertion of injury “amount[s] to little more than [an] attemp[t ] ‘to employ a federal court as a forum in which to air . . . generalized grievances about the conduct of government.”  &lt;em&gt;Valley Forge&lt;/em&gt;, 454 U. S., at 483 (omission in original) (quoting &lt;em&gt;Flast&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Cohen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/392/83"&gt;392 U. S. 83&lt;/a&gt;, 106 (1968)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Indeed, our standing precedents make crystal clear that, absent a showing of particularized harm, these sorts of fair-process grievances must be resolved through the political branches.  For it is in those branches “where democratic debate can occur and a wide variety of interests and views can be weighed.”  &lt;em&gt;Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 602 U. S., at 380.  By contrast, the exercise of judicial power, “which can so profoundly affect the lives, liberty, and property of those to whom it extends,” is a “tool of last resort,” to be invoked only “when the question is raised by a party whose  interests entitle him to raise it.”  &lt;em&gt;Valley Forge&lt;/em&gt;, 454 U. S., at 473–474 (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Finding no support for a nonparticularized “fair process” harm in either our precedents or the practices of the lower courts, the Court pivots to an analogy.  It suggests that, as a candidate running for office who has been told that votes will continue to be counted after election day, Bost is no different from a competitor in a 100-meter dash whose race is “unexpectedly extended to 105 meters.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 6.  According to the majority, each runner in the newly announced 105-meter race would obviously suffer, regardless of whether he “expects to finish strong.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  But whether any given runner is harmed by this rule change depends on a number of factors particular to each competitor, none of which the majority deigns to identify.  And, indeed, it is far from obvious that a runner with a track record like Bost’s—who expects to win both races based on sound statistical analyses of his current and past performance—would have the injury that begets Article III standing to involve the Judiciary in this rule-change dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Despite the imprecision of its analysis, the Court &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;clear about one thing today: Pinpointing the actual harm to candidates for elected office is no longer necessary for standing purposes.  Its remarkable holding jettisons the injury-in-fact requirement entirely.  Forget injury; political candidates need only have “a concrete and particularized &lt;em&gt;interest&lt;/em&gt; in the rules that govern the counting of votes in their elections, regardless whether those rules harm their electoral prospects or increase the cost of their campaigns.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 9 (emphasis added).  As &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Barrett &lt;/span&gt;explains, see &lt;em&gt;ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 4 (opinion concurring in judgment), this harm-free Article III standing rule finds no support in our precedents.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt; C&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Perhaps sensing the weakness of its novel, harm-free standing analysis, the Court resorts to policy arguments to bolster it.  It worries that requiring candidates to establish that they might lose the election will “channel” lawsuits “to shortly before election day—or worse, after.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 7.  “Only then,” the Court says, will a candidate really know whether an election regulation has impacted his race.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  And, worse still, a candidate trying to make such a showing could find himself in the “awkward” position of having to “plead and prove that voters who take advantage of the challenged rule will favor his rivals.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 8–9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The relevance of these practical concerns is unclear.  We have traditionally viewed Article III standing as an “irreducible” constitutional minimum, “not merely a troublesome hurdle to be overcome.”  &lt;em&gt;Valley Forge&lt;/em&gt;, 454 U. S., at 472, 476.  As such, Article III’s “essential and unchanging” constitutional mandates do not ordinarily yield to our policy judgment about when it would be most convenient for courts to hear particular kinds of suits.  &lt;em&gt;Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 602 U. S., at 380 (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  In any event, under our usual standing rules, a candidate (and our democracy) need not be put in the awkward position of waiting until the eve of an election or predicting an electoral loss with 100% accuracy.  Our cases recognize that a litigant who bases standing on “[a]n allegation of future injury” need only assert a “substantial &lt;em&gt;risk&lt;/em&gt; that the harm will occur.”  &lt;em&gt;Susan B. Anthony List&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Driehaus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/573/149"&gt;573 U. S. 149&lt;/a&gt;, 158 (2014) (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).  The substantial-risk standard is not especially exacting; it demands more than mere conjecture, but it does not require plaintiffs to prove that the alleged future harm is “literally certain” to occur.  &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt;, 568 U. S., at 414, n. 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Accordingly, at the motion-to-dismiss stage, a candidate need only plausibly allege that the challenged regulation creates a substantial risk of an election loss—he need not predict with certainty that the rule will cause him to lose.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Texas Democratic Party &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Benkiser&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/459_F.3d_582"&gt;459 F. 3d 582&lt;/a&gt;, 587 (CA5 2006) (concluding that a candidate who alleged that governmental action “threaten[ed] his election prospects” had established standing).  Alternatively, a candidate whose win is more secure could allege a substantial risk of some other concrete and particularized harm stemming from the challenged rule’s application, such as an existing or imminent financial or reputational injury.  Cf. &lt;em&gt;Federal Election Comm’n&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Ted Cruz for Senate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/289"&gt;596 U. S. 289&lt;/a&gt;, 296 (2022) (recognizing a winning candidate’s $10,000 expenditure as a “pocketbook harm” that “constitute[d] an injury in fact”); &lt;em&gt;Meese&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Keene&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/481/465"&gt;481 U. S. 465&lt;/a&gt;, 473–474 (1987) (finding standing where a candidate had “alleged and demonstrated” that a challenged disclosure rule would, among other harms, “adversely affect his reputation in the community”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Though it may be more difficult for candidates to satisfy the “substantial risk” standard at later stages of litigation, it is nowhere near impossible.  It does not require a  candidate to prove that the challenged rule guarantees his loss; it simply requires him to marshal enough evidence from which a court could conclude that the challenged rule presents a significant threat to his victory, his pocketbook, or his reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As we have recognized in other contexts, that sort of evidence may include an evaluation of the facts on the ground and statistical analyses.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Department of Commerce&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/752"&gt;588 U. S. 752&lt;/a&gt;, 767–768 (2019) (concluding that States had standing to challenge the inclusion of a citizenship question on the census, in light of statistical evidence “establish[ing] that noncitizen households have historically responded to the census at lower rates” and “that if noncitizen households [were] undercounted by as little as 2%” those States would “lose out on federal funds”).  In the electoral arena, preelection polling will often provide a relevant data set.  Candidates could also rely on historical data about how a particular rule has affected those who have run similar campaigns in the past.  And the relative advantages or disadvantages of various electoral processes can be scrutinized by the kinds of experts who are routinely hired to make these sorts of assessments.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Meese&lt;/em&gt;, 481 U. S., at 473–474 (finding standing where a candidate submitted “detailed affidavits, including one describing the results of an opinion poll and another containing the views of an experienced political analyst” to show that a challenged disclosure requirement “would substantially harm his chances for reelection” (footnote omitted)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Court’s suggestion that it is beyond a judge’s competency to evaluate whether an election rule causes a substantial risk of electoral loss, &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 7–9, is therefore both puzzling and unfounded.  A “substantial risk” of future harm has been the Article III imminent-injury standard for decades.  See &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt;, 568 U. S., at 414–415, n. 5 (collecting cases applying this standard).  And federal courts, including this one, have routinely applied that standard in a  variety of circumstances—essentially whenever a plaintiff maintains that state action is likely to harm him in the future.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Murthy&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Missouri&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/603/43"&gt;603 U. S. 43&lt;/a&gt;, 57–58 (2024) (&lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; challenge related to social media content moderation); &lt;em&gt;Department of Commerce&lt;/em&gt;, 588 U. S., at 766–767 (Administrative Procedure Act challenge to changes to the census); &lt;em&gt;Monsanto Co.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Geertson Seed Farms&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/561/139"&gt;561 U. S. 139&lt;/a&gt;, 153–155 (2010) (environmental challenge to regulations of genetically modified crops).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In short, our precedents establish that &lt;em&gt;certainty&lt;/em&gt; of future harm is not the benchmark, as the majority suggests.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 7.  Rather, all that is required is a plausible allegation (eventually followed by proof ) of a substantial &lt;em&gt;risk&lt;/em&gt; of future injury.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Bost fails to clear even that low bar.  At most, he alleges that he “risk[s] injury &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; untimely and illegal ballots cause [him] to lose [his] election” or “reduc[e ]” his “margin of victory” in a way that harms his reputation.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a–69a (emphasis added).  But his complaint and supplemental declaration include no—zero—allegations to support an inference that such risk exists, or is at all substantial, in his own case; for example, he never alleges that untimely ballots are more likely to break against him and in favor of his opponent.  Indeed, Bost appears to have disclaimed the need to include any such allegations before the Court of Appeals, where he argued that his “stated injury is not based on a risk of losing the election” and that “[n]either a change to his electoral fortunes nor any other effect is necessary to afford him standing.”  Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellants in No. 23–2644 (CA7), p. 19.  The Court today accepts that unprecedented contention, which flies in the face of both the particularity requirement and the substantial-risk standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Alarmingly, today’s ruling also has far-reaching implications beyond Bost’s election, since dispensing with our usual standing requirements opens the floodgates to  exactly the type of troubling election-related litigation the Court purportedly wants to avoid.  For example, under the Court’s new harm-free candidate-standing rule, an electoral candidate who loses in a landslide can apparently still file a disruptive legal action in federal court after the election is over.  All he must do is assert that an election rule somehow deprived him of a fair process—even if that rule played no role in the election’s outcome or otherwise caused him harm.  That possibility is especially concerning given the host of election-related regulations that States must promulgate when exercising their constitutional duty to set the “Times, Places, and Manner of holding Elections.”  Art. I, §4, cl. 1.  States regulate everything from a ballot’s chain of custody to its format—all of which the majority would permit candidates to challenge in court without offering any theory of how such rules harm them personally.  See Brief for District of Columbia et al. as &lt;em&gt;Amici Curiae&lt;/em&gt; 16–22 (describing the myriad state regulations at risk under Bost’s broad theory of standing).&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; It is impossible to square this outcome with the practical concerns the Court identifies.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 7 (emphasizing that “ ‘federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election’ ” (quoting &lt;em&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Democratic National Committee&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/589/423"&gt;589 U. S. 423&lt;/a&gt;, 424 (2020) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;))).  Ironically, then, it is the Court’s new and generous candidate-standing rule that invites late-breaking judicial intervention into the  political process in a manner that is “as practically untenable as it is undemocratic.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; While more tethered to our standing precedents, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Barrett’&lt;/span&gt;s pocketbook-injury theory is also insufficient to support Bost’s standing.  This is because it is well settled—in light of our decision in &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Amnesty Int’l USA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/398"&gt;568 U. S. 398&lt;/a&gt;—that plaintiffs “cannot manufacture standing by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 402.  Bost’s allegations establish only a hypothetical future harm, even when crediting them as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt;, we held that a group of attorneys and human-rights organizations lacked standing to challenge a provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) “authorizing the surveillance of individuals who are not ‘United States persons’ and are reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 401 (footnote omitted) (quoting &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1881a"&gt;50 U. S. C. §1881a&lt;/a&gt;).  The attorneys and organizations premised their standing argument on the possibility that their clients would be surveilled under FISA.  568 U. S., at 406.  That possibility, they said, required them to take “costly and burdensome measures” to protect their privacy, including avoiding “certain e-mail and phone conversations” and traveling to their clients “so that they [could] have in-person conversations.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 415.  Yet the attorneys and organizations “ha[d] no actual knowledge” of the Government’s surveillance practices under FISA.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 411.  They “merely speculate[d] and ma[de] assumptions about whether their communications” would be targeted.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  As a result, the measures they took to avoid surveillance could not satisfy Article III’s requirements.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 416.  Or, put differently, they could not “manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on  themselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm that [was] not certainly impending.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Bost’s alleged pocketbook injury is no different.  He fears that Illinois’s ballot-receipt deadline will allow the State to count illegal votes, which in turn might injure him by costing him an election or at least resulting in a diminished margin of victory that somehow damages his reputation.  Brief for Petitioners 18.  He has therefore hired poll watchers to monitor the State’s vote counting for an additional two weeks.  But, in the absence of any allegation establishing that he actually faces a substantial risk of losing the election or having his margin of victory diminished in a meaningful way, Bost has taken those precautions based on the mere (and by all accounts remote) possibility that such harms will otherwise materialize.  At bottom, then, Bost fears a “hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.”  568 U. S., at 416.  So any additional expenses Bost incurs to ward off that harm is not a proper basis for standing.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Bost nevertheless insists that his case is distinct from &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt; because he &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; that the State will apply its 14-day ballot-receipt deadline in his next election.  That fact, he says, sets him apart from the attorneys and human-rights organizations in &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt;, who could not prove that the Federal Government would invoke FISA against them or their clients.  Stated differently, Bost &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; certain that the State will apply the ballot-receipt deadline, whereas the &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt; plaintiffs could only speculate as to FISA’s future application.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This contention misunderstands &lt;em&gt;Clapper’&lt;/em&gt;s standing rule and how it applied in that case.  In &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt;, the harm the plaintiffs feared (unlawful surveillance) would occur at the precise moment that FISA was invoked against them or their clients.  And because the asserted injury stemmed directly from the application of the challenged regulation, the risk of future harm was tied directly to the risk of FISA’s  future application to the plaintiffs.  It mattered, then, that the possibility of FISA’s application was only speculative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Bost’s feared injury—the one he seeks to spend his way out of—is different in this respect, but it is no less speculative.  The harm Bost fears does &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;stem from the mere (certain) application of the State’s 14-day ballot-receipt deadline.  Rather, what triggers Bost’s spending is fear of a lost election or the diminution of his reputation—&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;., the possible downstream effects of the challenged election rule.  Thus, even though the rule’s application is certain, the feared harm is not; Bost has only speculated as to the possibility that this future, downstream harm will occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This means that Bost’s pocketbook injury is similar in all relevant respects to that presented by the plaintiffs in &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt;: He is spending money to ward off speculative future injury.  His case differs from &lt;em&gt;Clapper &lt;/em&gt;only insofar as the source of the harm he is seeking to alleviate is not the (uncertain) application of the regulation itself, but the (uncertain) effects of that regulation.  In other words, both Bost and the plaintiffs in &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt; spent money to mitigate a risk of injury that was only theoretical, not substantial.  And neither can leverage unnecessary expenditures into Article III standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Our decision in &lt;em&gt;Monsanto Co.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Geertson Seed Farms&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/561/139"&gt;561 U. S. 139&lt;/a&gt;, is not to the contrary.  There, we held that farmers who “established a reasonable probability” that genetically modified alfalfa seeds would cross-contaminate their organic alfalfa had standing based on the costly measures they had taken to protect their crops.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 153–155 (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The key phrase from our &lt;em&gt;Monsanto&lt;/em&gt; opinion is “reasonable probability.”  The farmers did not simply point to a hypothetical possibility of cross-contamination.  Instead, their allegations established that their fear of future harm was &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt;.  In particular, the farmers explained that modified alfalfa seeds were actually “ ‘being planted in all the  major alfalfa seed production areas with little regard to contamination to non-GMO seed production fields.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 154, n. 3.  The farmers also emphasized “ ‘the compact geographic area of the prime alfalfa seed producing areas and the fact that pollen is distributed by bees that have large natural range of activity.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  Accordingly, they &lt;em&gt;reasonably&lt;/em&gt; predicted that “ ‘the genetic contamination of the [modified] seed [would] rapidly spread through the seed growing regions.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Bost’s allegations, by comparison, fall well short of demonstrating a reasonable probability of future harm absent costly mitigation efforts.  He alleges only that he “risk[s] injury if untimely and illegal ballots cause [him] to lose” or diminish his “margin of victory,” leading “to the public perception that [his] constituents have concerns about [his] job performance.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a–69a.  Examined closely, Bost’s averment is that, if the vote counting continues, he &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; receive fewer votes, which &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; cause him to lose the election or &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;damage his reputation among voters and donors.  No other allegations make this harmful outcome likely or otherwise substantiate the risk that any of these potential problems might actually occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Barrett&lt;/span&gt; nevertheless suggests that the forgiving standard for motions to dismiss is enough to get Bost over the line.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 3, n. (opinion concurring in judgment).  But that standard cannot benefit a plaintiff like Bost, who is “armed with nothing more than conclusions.”  &lt;em&gt;Ashcroft&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Iqbal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/662"&gt;556 U. S. 662&lt;/a&gt;, 678–679 (2009).&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Bost’s  complaint identifies only a “speculative chain of possibilities,” and, as such, his allegations are insufficient to establish a reasonable probability of future harm.  &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt;, 568 U. S., at 414.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In an ironic twist, the majority correctly rejects &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Barrett&lt;/span&gt;’s pocketbook-injury theory analysis due to its speculative nature.  It rightly acknowledges that a plaintiff who relies on costs to establish standing “must incur those costs to ‘mitigate or avoid’ a ‘substantial risk’ of some independent harm.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 9 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Clapper&lt;/em&gt;, 568 U. S., at 414, n. 5).  And it recognizes that the independent harm Bost asserts—“discrepancies in late-arriving ballots”—amounts to “conjecture,” with “little support in the pleadings.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 9.  But rather than follow that observation where it leads, the majority crafts a new candidate-only standing rule, ignoring the patently speculative nature of Bost’s harm based on Bost’s more generalized “interest in a fair process.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; With respect to the majority’s harm-free, fair-process standing theory, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Barrett&lt;/span&gt; has the better of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; argument.  She correctly observes that the majority’s  conclusion relieves Bost “of having to show any real harm” and fails to hold him to the same standards that we apply to all other litigants.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4 (opinion concurring in judgment).  But, given the weaknesses of Bost’s allegations, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Barrett’&lt;/span&gt;s&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;standing theory would also unjustly benefit Bost, by permitting him to voluntarily spend his way into a federal forum absent any reasonable assertion that the challenged rule (as opposed to his own unsubstantiated fears and spending proclivities) has caused him to suffer an injury in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;III&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Forty-some years ago, in &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Lyons&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/461/95"&gt;461 U. S. 95 (1983)&lt;/a&gt;, this Court considered whether a plaintiff had standing to challenge the Los Angeles Police Department’s repeated use of life-threatening chokeholds on civilians who posed no threat of violence.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 105.  The plaintiff in that case, Adolph Lyons, suffered such a chokehold at the hands of police, “rendering him unconscious and causing damage to his larynx.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 97–98.  Fearing that he would again be subjected to a life-threatening chokehold, Lyons filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction that would bar the future use of that technique against civilians who posed no risk to officer safety.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 98.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We rejected Lyons’s legal action on standing grounds, holding that he had failed to establish a “real and immediate threat” of future harm.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 105.  None of Lyons’s appeals to fairness or common sense sufficed to persuade a majority of this Court that he had Article III standing.  It did not matter, for instance, that Lyons had almost died from an illegal chokehold only five months prior to filing his complaint.  See &lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  Nor did it matter that “no less than 16 persons ha[d] died following the use of a chokehold by an LAPD police officer” in the preceding decade.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 115–116 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Because those “odds” did not suggest a substantial risk of harm to Lyons in the future,  we said, he was not entitled to sue for injunctive relief.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 108 (majority opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).  So, despite the grievous wrong and physical harm that Lyons (and others like him) had suffered, we “decline[d] the invitation to slight the preconditions” of Article III.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 112.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; If only the &lt;em&gt;Lyons &lt;/em&gt;Court had seen fit to create the sort of harm-free, status-based standing rule that the majority adopts today.  The majority’s reasoning—leading to today’s holding that “[c]andidates have a concrete and particularized interest in the rules that govern the counting of votes in their elections, regardless whether those rules harm their electoral prospects or increase the cost of their campaigns,” &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 9—would have been useful to Lyons.  Lyons was a Los Angeles resident who had been unfairly targeted by police violence in the past and who wished to move freely about in the community.  Armed with today’s decision, Lyons might have successfully relied upon that status to claim a “concrete and particularized interest” in the rules that governed police officers’ encounters with certain community residents, regardless of whether such police practices would have harmed him in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  But the &lt;em&gt;Lyons&lt;/em&gt; standing rule focused on actual injury: We emphasized that a plaintiff must assert (and, ultimately, prove) that the allegedly unlawful practice risks injuring him in a concrete and particularized manner in the future.  The bare assertion of an interest in general fairness, absent the showing of any real and immediate harm, is apparently cognizable only if asserted by candidates for office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I am all for simplifying our standing law.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 10.  But I am against doing so selectively; either Article III standing requires an actual or imminent injury in fact that is particularized to the plaintiff, or it does not.  Bost has plainly failed to allege facts that support an inference of standing under our established precedents.  By carving out a bespoke rule for candidate-plaintiffs—granting them standing “to challenge the rules that govern the counting of votes,” simply and solely because they are “candidate[s]” for office, &lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;—the Court now complicates and destabilizes both our standing law and America’s electoral processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-1ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;  Lest we forget: In a democracy, elections are not mere candidate-centered bouts; rather, they determine the fate of the community.  Elections, after all, are the mechanism through which We the People (exercising our collective will) decide who gets to represent us.  In a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, “those who compete” in an election, &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 5, are ultimately vying to become public servants—not simply winners of a game.  Thus, it is misleading to suggest that those who “claim the right to voice the will of the people,” &lt;em&gt;ibid&lt;/em&gt;., have an exclusive interest in electoral fairness.  To the contrary, those “who lend their support” as voters, &lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;, are the primary stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-2ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  Here, Congressman Bost has not alleged that Illinois’s ballot-receipt deadline will undermine the public’s perception of the legitimacy of any future win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  “[I]f a State chose to conduct its election by, say, flipping a coin,” what is lost is not just a candidate’s “opportunity to compete for the people’s support.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4.  Another injurious consequence would be the lack of any incentive to vote, leading to both the elimination of democratic participation and the election of candidates who have no reason to operate for the public good—in short, the destruction of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-4ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;  The Government, participating as an &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; in support of petitioners, also suggests that our typical Article III standing requirements do not apply here, though for a different reason than the Court.  In its view, we can presume that Bost has identified an injury in fact because he is the “direct object” of Illinois’s ballot-receipt deadline.  Brief for United States as &lt;em&gt;Amicus Curiae &lt;/em&gt;21.  To be sure, when a plaintiff is the direct “object” of “government action or inaction,” there “is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury.”  &lt;em&gt;Lujan&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Defenders of Wildlife&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/504/555"&gt;504 U. S. 555&lt;/a&gt;, 561–562 (1992).  But Bost is not a direct object of the Illinois rule at issue.  The rule regulates the conduct of voters and election officials, dictating how and when ballots are cast and counted.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 10, §5/19–8(c) (West Supp. 2025) (“Each vote by mail voter’s ballot that is mailed to an election authority and postmarked no later than election day, but that is received . . . before the close of the period for counting provisional ballots cast at that election, . . . shall be counted”).  And we have recently reaffirmed that, “when (as here) a plaintiff challenges the government’s ‘unlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of &lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt;,’ ” standing “ ‘is ordinarily substantially more difficult to establish.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;FDA &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/367"&gt;602 U. S. 367&lt;/a&gt;, 382 (2024) (quoting &lt;em&gt;Lujan&lt;/em&gt;, 504 U. S., at 562).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-5ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;  The Court’s suggestion that these sorts of challenges are unlikely, &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 10, n. 7, is belied by recent experience.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;League of Women Voters of Fla. Inc. &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Florida Secretary of State&lt;/em&gt;, 66 F. 4th 905, 929 (CA11 2023) (considering a challenge to a “drop-box provision” that governed “the chain of custody of the ballot” (internal quotation marks omitted)); &lt;em&gt;Kim &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Hanlon&lt;/em&gt;, 99 F. 4th 140, 147, 153 (CA3 2024) (noting that “[c]ourts often decide ballot-design cases” in considering a challenge to “the form of election ballots” in the State of New Jersey).  Without a harm-based standing rule for candidates, these kinds of challenges will undoubtedly become even more common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-6ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  I do not reject the view that it is reasonable to employ poll watchers to monitor discrepancies in the vote count as a general matter.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 3, n. (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Barrett, J.&lt;/span&gt;, opinion concurring in judgment).  But a proper Article III standing analysis requires us to answer a different question: whether it was reasonable &lt;em&gt;for this particular plaintiff&lt;/em&gt; to voluntarily incur such costs under the circumstances presented in his case.  At the motion-to-dismiss stage, we are only obligated to credit the plausible assertions of fact the plaintiff makes to support that inference.  We do not have to accept Bost’s bald contention that he has to hire poll watchers in light of Illinois’s rule (or make the inference that it is reasonable for him to do so during the upcoming election); indeed, in my view, accepting that conclusory contention abdicates our responsibility to actually evaluate the sufficiency of the plaintiff ’s allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-7ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;  Bost’s concern that his reputation might be damaged even if he wins—due to a diminished margin of victory, see Brief for Petitioners 18—is especially difficult to fathom, much less designate as plausible.  I suppose it is possible that voters and donors will think less of Bost as an official if he wins by 74% of the vote instead of 75%, regardless of his performance while in office.  See 114 F. 4th 634, 642 (CA7 2024) (case below) (observing that Bost won the 2022 election with 75% of the vote).&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But that result is neither obvious nor intuitive.  In fact, without more specific allegations, one might just as easily speculate that a closer race would &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; Bost, as it could generate more donations and enthusiasm among his core supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_6-8ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;  Contemporary commentators predicted that our decision in &lt;em&gt;Lyons&lt;/em&gt; would close the door to “a broad range of analogous lawsuits” aimed at systemic misconduct and abuse on the part of law enforcement.  R. Fallon, Of Justiciability, Remedies, and Public Law Litigation: Notes on the Jurisprudence of Lyons, 59 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1, 71–72 (1984).  That prediction proved accurate.  Today, courts routinely rely on &lt;em&gt;Lyons&lt;/em&gt; to deny plaintiffs standing to seek injunctions against future police behavior.  See, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;J. W. ex rel.

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;BARRETT v. UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 24–5774. Argued October 7, 2025—Decided January 14, 2026&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;This case concerns the relationship between two provisions of &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924"&gt;18 U. S. C. §924&lt;/a&gt;: subsection (c)(1)(A)(i), which criminalizes using, carrying, or possessing a firearm in connection with a federal crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, and subsection (j), which prescribes different penalties—including, in certain circumstances, capital punishment—when “a violation of subsection (c)” causes death.  The question presented is whether a single act that violates both provisions may yield two convictions—one under each provision—or only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;   The Second Circuit held that one such act may yield two convictions.  The Second Circuit acknowledged that subsection (c)(1) and subsection (j) qualify as the same offense under the test in &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/284/299"&gt;284 U. S. 299&lt;/a&gt;.  But it believed that, as construed in &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/453"&gt;599 U. S. 453&lt;/a&gt;, the two provisions are separate offenses for which Congress has clearly authorized cumulative punishments.  Because the Second Circuit’s decision deepened a split among the Courts of Appeals, this Court granted certiorari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Held&lt;/em&gt;: Congress did not clearly authorize convictions under both §§924(c)(1)(A)(i) and (j) for a single act that violates both provisions.  One act that violates both provisions therefore may spawn only one conviction.  The part of the Second Circuit’s judgment that held otherwise is reversed.  Pp. 5–19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; (a) When enacted, §924(c) “made it a discrete offense” to use or carry a firearm in connection with a predicate federal crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.  &lt;em&gt;Abbott&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/8"&gt;562 U. S. 8&lt;/a&gt;, 12.  A §924(c) violation triggers a mandatory minimum sentence of at least five years.  Congress later added §924(j) to provide a different penalty scheme for §924(c) violations that cause death.  Section 924(j) has no  mandatory minimums; it instead authorized significant maximum sentences, including the death penalty or life in prison when the underlying violation is murder.  Pp. 5–8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; (b) The question in this case is whether subsection (j) also increased the number of convictions (rather than just the maximum sentence) that can result from a fatal violation of §924(c)(1)(A)(i).  The Court resolves the question as a matter “of statutory construction,” because “whether punishments . . . are unconstitutionally multiple cannot be resolved without determining what punishments the Legislative Branch has authorized.”  &lt;em&gt;Whalen&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/445/684"&gt;445 U. S. 684&lt;/a&gt;, 688.  And the Court undertakes this exercise in statutory construction with a thumb on the scale in the form of the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; presumption, which instructs that Congress ordinarily does not intend to punish the same offense under two different statutes.  It is undisputed that §924(c)(1)(A)(i) and §924(j) define the same offense per &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;.  But the Court has said that the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; presumption can yield to a plainly expressed contrary intent.  This case therefore turns on whether Congress plainly expressed an intent to overcome the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; presumption by authorizing multiple convictions for one act that violates both §924(c)(1)(A)(i) and §924(j).  To ascertain such intent, the Court turns to statutory text, structure, and (for those who accept its help) legislative history.  Pp. 8–10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; (c) The text of §924 suggests strongly, perhaps conclusively, that Congress did not disavow &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; here.  Congress included &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;-surmounting language twice within subsection (c) itself: It mandated that a §924(c)(1) conviction must be “in addition to the punishment provided for” the predicate, and it also mandated that a conviction under §924(c)(5)—for using or carrying armor piercing ammunition—must be “in addition to the punishment provided for” the predicate “or conviction under” §924.  The Court has elsewhere called such “in addition to” language “crystal clear” evidence of a legislature’s intent to overcome &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;.  But Congress used no similar language with respect to the interplay between subsection (c)(1) and subsection (j).  Pp. 10–14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  (1) The argument that subsection (c)’s consecutive-sentence mandate textually authorizes dual convictions misunderstands the inquiry.  &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; addresses the permissibility of multiple convictions, not just multiple sentences; the assumption underlying the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; rule is that Congress ordinarily does not intend to punish the same offense under two different statutes, where punishment means a criminal conviction and not simply the imposition of sentence.  Accordingly, §924(c)'s consecutive-sentence mandate simply speaks past the question in this case: whether one act may result in two convictions.  Before the consecutive-sentence mandate gains any  relevance, a court must first determine whether two punishments (convictions) may be imposed at all.  Only if two convictions may coexist does a court consult the consecutive-sentence mandate to arrange properly the resulting sentences.  Pp. 11–13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  (2) The argument that subsection (c)(1) and subsection (j) have different focuses and thus target different wrongs that may be punished cumulatively is equally unavailing.  The conduct (or result) that differentiates a greater offense from its lesser included offenses will often introduce some new focus, and that reality cannot do much to overcome the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; presumption if the presumption is to retain its force.  Pp. 13–14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; (d) The statute’s operation and structure provide no indication Congress expressed any will to overcome &lt;em&gt;Blockburger.  Lora &lt;/em&gt;answers any concern that defendants convicted of and sentenced under subsection (j) will be rewarded with more lenient sentences than those convicted of the less serious subsection (c)(1) offense.  There the Court explained that subsection (j) eschews mandatory penalties in favor of sentencing flexibility and reflects the seriousness of the offense using a different approach than subsection (c)’s mandatory minimum penalties—by authorizing the death penalty for murder and the same harsh punishment that the Federal Criminal Code prescribes for other manslaughters.  If prosecutors fear that a subsection (j) sentence will dip below what subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) would otherwise guarantee, they are free to choose subsection (c)(1)(A)(i)’s low-end rigidity over subsection (j)’s high-end flexibility.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Neither the physical separation in the U. S. Code between subsection (c)(1) and subsection (j), nor the fact that subsection (j)’s sentencing scheme operates without reference to subsection (c)’s, overcomes the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; presumption.  See &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/470/856"&gt;470 U. S. 856&lt;/a&gt;.  If offenses share elements but have comprehensive, independently operating penalty schemes, that suggests Congress intended to place in front of prosecutors a menu, not a buffet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Any analogy to &lt;em&gt;Garrett&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/471/773"&gt;471 U. S. 773&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Court found &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; overcome even without express statutory language disclaiming the presumption, is inapt.  &lt;em&gt;Garrett&lt;/em&gt; involved a continuing criminal enterprise alleged to have spanned more than five years, and the continuing nature of the offense played a decisive role in the case.  &lt;em&gt;Garrett &lt;/em&gt;distinguished the facts there from what is involved here: the classic relation of the lesser included offense to the greater offense, wherein the very same conduct violates two statutes.  Pp. 15–19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;102 F. 4th 60, reversed in part and remanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;DWAYNE BARRETT, PETITIONER &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[January 14, 2026]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt; delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IV–C.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This case concerns the relationship between two provisions of &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924"&gt;18 U. S. C. §924&lt;/a&gt;.  The first, §924(c)(1)(A)(i), criminalizes using, carrying, or possessing a firearm in connection with a federal crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.  The second, §924(j), prescribes different penalties—including, in certain circumstances, capital punishment—when “a violation of subsection (c)” causes death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Every defendant subject to subsection (j) has also, necessarily, violated subsection (c).  We consider here whether a defendant who commits a single act that violates both §924(c)(1)(A)(i) and §924(j) may be convicted only under one provision or the other, or instead may suffer two convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; All agree on the first step of the analysis: Subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) and subsection (j) define the same offense under the test set forth in &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/284/299"&gt;284 U. S. 299 (1932)&lt;/a&gt;.  That consensus carries us most of the way to resolving this case, as we have long presumed that Congress intends to authorize only one conviction per offense.   We resolve the rest by concluding that this presumption holds true here:  Congress intended subsection (j) as an alternative, not a supplement, to subsection (c)(1)(A)(i).  At the very least, Congress did not clearly manifest a contrary intention, as it would have to do if it wished to authorize two convictions in these circumstances.  We thus reverse in part the Second Circuit’s contrary judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Dwayne Barrett committed a series of robberies between August 2011 and January 2012.  During one, Barrett’s confederate shot and killed Gamar Dafalla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Of the seven charges on which Barrett was convicted, three are relevant here.  Count five charged Barrett with Hobbs Act robbery of Dafalla under &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1951"&gt;18 U. S. C. §1951&lt;/a&gt;.  That count served as the predicate for two more: Count six charged Barrett with using a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence in violation of §924(c)(1)(A)(i),&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and count seven charged him with thereby causing death in violation of §924(j)(1).&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  A jury found Barrett guilty on all seven counts, and the District Court sentenced Barrett to a total term of 90 years of imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Barrett has since been aided by two of our decisions.  After we decided &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/445"&gt;588 U. S. 445 (2019)&lt;/a&gt;, and vacated the Second Circuit’s disposition of Barrett’s direct appeal in light of that decision, the Second Circuit vacated one of Barrett’s §924(c) convictions not at issue here.  See &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/918"&gt;588 U. S. 918 (2019)&lt;/a&gt; (granting Barrett’s petition for a writ of certiorari, vacating the judgment, and remanding for further consideration in light of &lt;em&gt;Davis&lt;/em&gt;); &lt;a href="/rio/citation/937_F.3d_126"&gt;937 F. 3d 126&lt;/a&gt;, 127–128 (2019) (vacating the conviction).  The District Court then resentenced Barrett to 50 years in prison.  Twenty of those years came from concurrent sentences on three Hobbs Act robbery counts, including, as relevant here, count five.  Twenty-five years came from a consecutive term on count seven (the subsection (j) conviction), into which the District Court merged count six (the subsection (c) conviction).&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Then we decided &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/453"&gt;599 U. S. 453 (2023)&lt;/a&gt;, which, like this case, addressed the relationship between subsections (c) and (j).  &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt; held that subsection (j) does not incorporate subsection (c)’s consecutive-sentence mandate.  That mandate requires a subsection (c) sentence to run consecutively to “any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person.”  §924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  It does not, we held in &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt;, require the same of a subsection (j) sentence.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 459.  When the District Court sentenced Barrett in this case, it had been under the opposite impression.  So Barrett appealed again, and, bound by &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt;, the Second Circuit vacated Barrett’s sentence and remanded for another resentencing.  102 F. 4th 60, 85–88 (2024).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In doing so, the Court of Appeals also passed upon the question that now comes before us.  The District Court, recall, had declined to sentence Barrett separately on counts six (under subsection (c)) and seven (under subsection (j)), both of which had as their predicate the same fatal Dafalla robbery charged in count five.  The Court of Appeals rejected Barrett’s argument that the Double Jeopardy Clause required the District Court to stay that course when the case returned for resentencing.  The Court of Appeals did acknowledge that the Government regularly concedes that subsection (c)(1) and subsection (j) overlap and may not be punished cumulatively—a proposition with which the other circuits regularly agree.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 91, and n. 29 (collecting cases).  And it recognized that the two provisions qualify as the same offense under the governing test laid out in &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;.  102 F. 4th, at 89–90.  But it believed that, “[a]s construed in &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt;,” the two provisions “are separate offenses for which Congress has clearly authorized cumulative punishments.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 89.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Textually, the court pointed to §924(c)(1)(D)(ii)’s mandate that a subsection (c) sentence must run consecutively to any other sentence—including, the court reasoned, to one under subsection (j).  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 90–91.  Practically, the court highlighted that a contrary ruling would permit defendants who commit especially serious subsection (c) offenses—ones resulting in death—to escape subsection (c)’s mandatory minimums, despite “Congress’s intent for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; defendant convicted under that statute . . . to be incarcerated for no less than the stated minimum term.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 90; see also &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 93–94.  And, turning to precedent, the court perceived our statement in &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt; that subsection (j) evinced a “ ‘different approach to punishment’ ” than subsection (c) to establish that the two provisions define different offenses raising no double jeopardy concerns.  102 F. 4th, at 92–93 (quoting 599 U. S., at 462).  The Court of Appeals therefore instructed the District Court to impose separate convictions and sentences on counts six and seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Because the Second Circuit’s decision deepened a split among the Courts of Appeals, we granted certiorari.  604 U. S. ___ (2025).&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  And because the Government agrees with Barrett, we appointed an &lt;em&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/em&gt; to defend the Second Circuit’s judgment.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  We now reverse the Second Circuit’s judgment in relevant part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: justify; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; When Congress passed &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924#c"&gt;18 U. S. C. §924(c)&lt;/a&gt; in 1968, the new subsection “made it a discrete offense” to use or carry a firearm in connection with a federal crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, known as predicates.  &lt;em&gt;Abbott&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/8"&gt;562 U. S. 8&lt;/a&gt;, 12 (2010).&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  The original statute left open two questions relevant to today’s case.  It did not specify whether a subsection (c) conviction could coexist with, or instead must displace, a conviction for the underlying predicate.  And assuming two convictions could coexist, it did not specify whether the two resulting sentences should run concurrently or consecutively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Congress answered both questions in 1971.  On the first, Congress made clear that a subsection (c) conviction must be “ ‘in addition to the punishment provided for the commission of ’ ” the predicate; that is, a violation of subsection (c) ought to result in two convictions, one for subsection (c) and one for the predicate.  §13, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/84_Stat._1890"&gt;84 Stat. 1890&lt;/a&gt;.  On the second, Congress mandated that the two resulting sentences run consecutively, not concurrently: “ ‘[T]he term of imprisonment imposed under this subsection [shall not] run concurrently with any term of imprisonment imposed for’ ” the predicate.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Congress later extended this second feature—the consecutive-sentence mandate—beyond the relationship between subsection (c)’s sentence and the predicate’s sentence, so that the consecutive-sentence mandate applies as between a subsection (c) sentence and “any other term of imprisonment.”  §924(c)(1)(D)(ii); see &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Gonzales&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/520/1"&gt;520 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 5 (1997).  Congress did not, however, expand the double-conviction mandate.  That mandate still instructs only that a subsection (c)(1) conviction shall be “in addition to the punishment provided for [the underlying] crime of violence or drug trafficking crime”—that is, the predicate.  §924(c)(1)(A).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Subsection (c) can be violated in several ways but all trigger mandatory minimum sentences.  Subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of five years; other provisions within subsection (c)(1) impose mandatory minimums up to life in prison, depending on the use and type of weapon and the defendant’s recidivist history.  See §924(c)(1).&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  So if the predicate offense carries a mandatory minimum sentence of its own, then a defendant will face “ ‘two consecutive mandatory minimum sentences for the single use of a single firearm.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Abbott&lt;/em&gt;, 562 U. S., at 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This case asks whether a different subsection of §924, subsection (j), piles yet another layer of punishment atop—resulting in &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; stacked convictions and sentences—or instead provides an alternative to subsection (c)(1)(A)(i). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Subsection (j) arrived “decades after subsection (c).”  &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt;, 599 U. S., at 457.  Congress added it in 1994, in a provision entitled “Death Penalty for Gun Murders During Federal Crimes of Violence and Drug Trafficking Crimes.”  §60013, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/108_Stat._1973"&gt;108 Stat. 1973&lt;/a&gt;.  The new subsection supplied a different penalty scheme for subsection (c) violations that cause death.  Unlike subsection (c), subsection (j) did not impose mandatory minimums.  Instead, it authorized significant &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; sentences—including, true to the new provision’s name, the death penalty if the underlying violation is a murder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “A person who, in the course of a violation of subsection (c), causes the death of a person through the use of a firearm, shall—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “(1) if the killing is a murder (as defined in section 1111), be punished by death or by imprisonment for any term of years or for life; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “(2) if the killing is manslaughter (as defined in section 1112), be punished as provided in that section.”  §924(j).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The references to §1111 and §1112 relate to the pre-existing murder and manslaughter statutes, respectively.  Section 1111 sets a maximum penalty of death or life imprisonment for murder.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111#b"&gt;18 U. S. C. §1111(b)&lt;/a&gt;.  And §1112 sets a maximum penalty of 15 years for voluntary manslaughter and 8 years for involuntary manslaughter.  §1112(b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Subsection (j) gave federal prosecutors tools they lacked both in the pre-existing subsection (c) and in the pre-existing murder and manslaughter statutes.  Subsection (c) does not authorize the death penalty, for example.  Subsection (j) thus raised the ceiling of punishments §924 authorized, and, in doing so, offered prosecutors flexibility of another sort: time.  See §3281 (“An indictment for any offense punishable by death may be found at any time without limitation”).  Section 1111—the general federal murder statute—did already authorize the death penalty.  But its jurisdictional reach, as well as that of the manslaughter statute (§1112), is limited to “the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.”  §§1111(b), 1112(b).&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  The new subsection (j) had no such geographical limitation; it borrowed instead subsection (c)’s broader jurisdictional hook.  So subsection (j) expanded federal jurisdiction over more killings and authorized the death penalty for those amounting to murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;III&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This case asks whether subsection (j) also increased the number of convictions—rather than simply the maximum sentence—that can result from a fatal violation of §924(c)(1)(A)(i).  Barrett says it did not, and for support he turns to the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment"&gt;Fifth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;’s Double Jeopardy Clause.  But while his argument arrives in constitutional garb, it “cannot be separated entirely from a resolution of the question of statutory construction.”  &lt;em&gt;Whalen&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/445/684"&gt;445 U. S. 684&lt;/a&gt;, 688 (1980).  That is because “the question whether punishments . . . are unconstitutionally multiple cannot be resolved without determining what punishments the Legislative Branch has authorized.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.  &lt;/em&gt;It is that question of congressional authorization that we answer today.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We undertake this exercise in statutory interpretation with a thumb on the scale, in the form of the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; presumption.  Named for &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/284/299"&gt;284 U. S. 299&lt;/a&gt;, the presumption instructs “that Congress ordinarily does not intend to punish the same offense under two different statutes.”  &lt;em&gt;Whalen&lt;/em&gt;, 445 U. S., at 691–692.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The first step in the inquiry, then, is to determine whether §924(c)(1)(A)(i) and §924(j) define the “same offense.”  To make that determination, &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; requires us to compare the provisions in question and ask whether “each . . . requires proof of a fact which the other does not.”  284 U. S., at 304.  If the answer is yes, then the offenses prescribed by each statute are different and the inquiry generally ends.  If the answer is no, then the statutes define the same offense, and the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; presumption is triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; But because we have treated &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; as “a rule of statutory construction to help determine legislative intent,” we have said that its presumption can yield to a “plainly expressed” intent to abandon it.  &lt;em&gt;Garrett&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/471/773"&gt;471 U. S. 773&lt;/a&gt;, 778–779 (1985); see also &lt;em&gt;Whalen&lt;/em&gt;, 445 U. S., at 692 (requiring “a clear indication of contrary legislative intent”).  Accordingly, the second step of today’s analysis requires us to search for a clear manifestation of Congress’s intent to authorize more than one punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; All involved in this case share common ground as to the first step of the analysis.  The Court of Appeals, Barrett, the Government, and Court-appointed &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; agree that §924(c)(1)(A)(i) and §924(j) define the same offense.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  After all, the relationship between subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) and subsection (j) is “the classic relation of the ‘lesser included offense’ to the greater offense,” wherein “[t]he very same conduct” violates two statutes, one which is fully subsumed within the other.  &lt;em&gt;Garrett&lt;/em&gt;, 471 U. S., at 787.  And all lesser included offenses are the “same” as their greater cousins under &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;.  See&lt;em&gt; Almendarez-Torres&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/523/224"&gt;523 U. S. 224&lt;/a&gt;, 231 (1998) (“[T]he federal courts have [long] presumed that Congress does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; intend for a defendant to be cumulatively punished for two crimes where one crime is a lesser included offense of the other”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This case therefore turns on the analysis’s second step: discerning whether Congress clearly intended to authorize multiple convictions for one act that violates both §924(c)(1)(A)(i) and §924(j).  To ascertain such intent, we turn to statutory text, structure, and (for those who accept its help) legislative history.  See &lt;em&gt;Garrett&lt;/em&gt;, 471 U. S., at 779; &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Woodward&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/469/105"&gt;469 U. S. 105&lt;/a&gt;, 109 (1985) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;) (consulting “[a]ll guides to legislative intent”).  Only if those tools leave us certain that Congress intended to break from its normal practice and authorize multiple convictions for the same offense will we shed the presumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;IV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: justify; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We begin with the text.  Textual clues are critical because “Congress [i]s aware of the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; rule and legislate[s] with it in mind.”  &lt;em&gt;Albernaz&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/450/333"&gt;450 U. S. 333&lt;/a&gt;, 342 (1981).  So Congress typically includes &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;-surmounting language when it wishes to authorize dual convictions for the same offense.  See Brief for Petitioner 28, n. 3 (listing examples).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The text of §924 suggests strongly, perhaps conclusively, that Congress did not disavow &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; here.  Not for lack of know-how: Congress twice wrote &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;-surmounting language into&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;subsection (c) itself.  Congress mandated that a §924(c)(1) conviction must be “in addition to the punishment provided for” the predicate, and it also mandated that a §924(c)(5) conviction—for using or carrying “armor piercing ammunition”—must be “in addition to the punishment provided for” the predicate “or conviction under” §924.  See §§924(c)(1)(A), (c)(5).  We have elsewhere called such “in addition to” language “crystal clear” evidence of a legislature’s intent to overcome &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Missouri&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/459/359"&gt;459 U. S. 359&lt;/a&gt;, 362, 368 (1983).&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In short, “[w]hen Congress has the will” to authorize dual convictions for the same offense, Congress “has no difficulty in expressing it.”  &lt;em&gt;Bell&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/349/81"&gt;349 U. S. 81&lt;/a&gt;, 83 (1955).  But Congress used no similar language with respect to the interplay between subsection (c)(1) and subsection (j). Its silence on the topic speaks volumes.  See &lt;em&gt;Albernaz&lt;/em&gt;, 450 U. S., at 341–342.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Like the Court of Appeals, see 102 F. 4th, at 90–93, &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; challenges the premise of this assessment: He insists that Congress &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; textually authorized dual convictions under subsection (c)(1) and subsection (j).  For proof, he points to subsection (c)’s consecutive-sentence mandate.  It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;“Notwithstanding any other provision of law . . . no term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person, including any term of imprisonment imposed for the crime of violence or drug trafficking crime during which the firearm was used, carried, or possessed.”  §924(c)(1)(D)(ii).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; would have it, this instruction permits—actually, requires—a subsection (c)(1) conviction to add on to any other conviction, including one under subsection (j).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This deployment of the consecutive-sentence mandate misunderstands today’s inquiry.  The argument attempts to make &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; purely about &lt;em&gt;sentences&lt;/em&gt;—so that an instruction to run sentences consecutively rather than concurrently makes clear Congress’s intent to overcome the presumption.  But &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; addresses the permissibility of multiple &lt;em&gt;convictions&lt;/em&gt;, not just multiple sentences.  “The assumption underlying the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; rule is that Congress ordinarily does not intend to punish the same offense under two different statutes,” where “punishment” means “a criminal conviction and not simply the imposition of sentence.”  &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/470/856"&gt;470 U. S. 856&lt;/a&gt;, 861 (1985).  It is for this reason that running sentences concurrently does not avoid the problem; an unauthorized “ ‘second conviction, even if it results in no greater sentence, is an impermissible punishment.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Rutledge&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/517/292"&gt;517 U. S. 292&lt;/a&gt;, 302 (1996) (quoting &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt;, 470 U. S., at 865).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Accordingly, §924(c)’s consecutive-sentence mandate simply speaks past the question in this case: whether one act may result in two convictions.  To that question it is no answer to say, as the consecutive-sentence mandate does, that a “term of imprisonment imposed” for a conviction shall run consecutively to “any other term of imprisonment imposed.”  §924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  Before the consecutive-sentence mandate gains any relevance, a court must first determine whether two punishments (convictions) may be imposed at all.  Only if two convictions may coexist does a court consult the consecutive-sentence mandate, to arrange properly the resulting sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This description is not merely the law as it exists; it is the law as Congress understands it.  When Congress amended subsection (c) in 1971, it added two distinct instructions, as recited above.  The first—that a subsection (c)(1) conviction must be “in addition to the punishment provided for” the predicate—answers the threshold question: May one act spawn two convictions, one for subsection (c)(1) and one for the predicate?  The second—the consecutive-sentence mandate—answers the follow-on question: Presuming the existence of two convictions, should their resulting sentences run concurrently or consecutively?  Cf. &lt;em&gt;Dean&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/581/62"&gt;581 U. S. 62&lt;/a&gt;, 69–70 (2017) (describing these provisions as “two” distinct “limitations”).  &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt; would have the second instruction answer the first question.  But Congress has already addressed it: A subsection (c)(1) conviction adds to the predicate conviction.  See §924(c)(1)(A).  Nowhere does the statute prescribe the same in relation to a subsection (j) conviction.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt;’s second textual argument is equally unavailing.  Turning away from the concrete and toward the abstract, &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; tells us that subsection (c)(1) and subsection (j) have different focuses.  Subsection (c)(1), he points out, calibrates its punishments to “the use of the firearm, the type of firearm, and recidivism.”  Brief for Court-Appointed &lt;em&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/em&gt; 10.  By contrast, subsection (j) focuses on something “irrelevant” to subsection (c)(1): the harm (namely, death) inflicted.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  From this &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; urges us to conclude that the two subsections “target different wrongs” and thus may be punished cumulatively.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;; see also &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 17–18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In our search for congressional intent, we might in some circumstances think that when two provisions focus on entirely “different interests,” that suggests Congress intended them to accumulate rather than swap out.  See &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Dixon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/509/688"&gt;509 U. S. 688&lt;/a&gt;, 724 (1993) (White, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); see also &lt;em&gt;Albernaz&lt;/em&gt;, 450 U. S., at 343 (observing that the Court’s conclusion about the permissibility of dual convictions was “reinforced by the fact that the two . . . statutes are directed to separate evils”).  Whatever those circumstances, this is not one.  &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt; stretches to find a common thread running throughout subsection (c)(1)—he bundles firearm use, firearm type, and recidivism and places them in opposition to harm.  But it is not obvious that those three features form a theme of any significance such that they can create the contrast &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; wants to glean from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In any event, the conduct (or result) that differentiates a greater offense from its lesser included offenses will often introduce some new “focus.”  That reality cannot do much to overcome the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; presumption if the presumption is to retain its force.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Whalen&lt;/em&gt;, 445 U. S., at 691, n. 6, 693–694 (&lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; not overcome, despite some contrary statutory language, for convictions on charges of (1) rape and (2) killing in the course of rape); &lt;em&gt;Illinois&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Vitale&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/447/410"&gt;447 U. S. 410&lt;/a&gt;, 420–421 (1980) (&lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; not overcome as between felony and felony murder); &lt;em&gt;Harris&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/433/682"&gt;433 U. S. 682&lt;/a&gt;, 682–683 (1977) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;) (same).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In sum, if Congress expressed any will to overcome &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; in this scenario, it must be found somewhere other than the statutory text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Failing textual support, &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; turns to the statute’s operation and structure.  But this ground proves only slightly more fertile.  Primarily, &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; fears that defendants convicted of and sentenced under subsection (j) will be rewarded with more lenient sentences than those convicted of the less serious subsection (c)(1) offense.  He points out that subsection (c)(1) imposes mandatory minimums while subsection (j) speaks in terms of maximums.  And he insists that, rather than let subsection (j) offenders out from under subsection (c)(1)’s mandatory minimums, Congress must have intended to authorize subsection (c)(1)’s mandatory minimums &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; any punishment doled out under subsection (j).  Cf. &lt;em&gt;Abbott&lt;/em&gt;, 562 U. S., at 21 (rejecting construction of §924(c) under which “the worst offenders would often secure the shortest sentences”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt; answers this concern without breaking a sweat. There, we explained that subsection (j)—along with several other provisions enacted simultaneously—“eschews mandatory penalties in favor of sentencing flexibility.”  599 U. S., at 462.  It was not lost on us in &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt;, nor is it now, that subsection (j) defines an especially serious offense.  Subsection (j) simply “reflects th[at] seriousness . . . using a different approach than subsection (c)’s mandatory penalties”: by authorizing the death penalty for murder and “the same harsh punishment that the Federal Criminal Code prescribes for other manslaughters.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 463.  It is for this reason, among others, that &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt;—anticipating the question this case presents—explained that our conclusion in that case “aligns with” the mutually exclusive relationship between subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) and subsection (j) that we endorse today.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 461.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Just as subsection (j)’s seriousness is not lost on us, we are confident—as Congress apparently was—that it will not be lost on sentencing judges.  Bound by &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3553#a"&gt;18 U. S. C. §3553(a)&lt;/a&gt; to craft a sentence that, among other considerations, reflects “the seriousness of the offense” and avoids “unwarranted sentence disparities” among similarly situated defendants, sentencing judges will doubtless recognize the relevance of a victim’s death when sentencing under subsection (j).  &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt;’s worry thus strikes us as more theoretical than realistic.  But if it threatens to manifest, it is not without remedy: If, in a given case, prosecutors fear that a subsection (j) sentence will dip below what subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) would otherwise guarantee, they are free to choose subsection (c)(1)(A)(i)’s low-end rigidity over subsection (j)’s high-end flexibility.  See &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt;, 470 U. S., at 860–861, nn. 7–8.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; There is a textual answer to this concern, too, and here (again) §924(c)(5) plays the foil.  That provision, which pertains to the use of armor-piercing ammunition, states that, “in addition to the punishment provided for” the predicate “or conviction under this section,” a defendant shall face a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years “&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;,” if death results, shall be sentenced in accordance with a scheme that mirrors subsection (j)’s.  (Emphasis added.)  This illustrates that, when Congress wished to preserve a mandatory minimum it feared might otherwise disappear, it so specified.  But subsection (j), we explained in &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt;, is “cast from a different mold.”  599 U. S., at 461.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Next, &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; highlights the physical separation in the U. S. Code between subsections (c)(1) and (j).  And he underscores their independent operation, emphasizing that subsection (j)’s sentencing scheme operates without reference to subsection (c)’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We have not bought such arguments before.  Consider, for instance, the statutes at issue in &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt;—statutes whose elements overlapped but whose sentencing schemes diverged.  Those provisions, which were then located at &lt;a href="/uscode/text/18"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; U. S. C. §§&lt;a href="/uscode/text/18/922#h"&gt;922(h)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/uscode/text/18/1202#a"&gt;1202(a)&lt;/a&gt;, prohibited certain categories of people from, respectively, &lt;em&gt;receiving&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;possessing&lt;/em&gt; certain firearms.  The provisions occupied parts of the Code much farther apart than the subsections of §924 at issue here.  And in &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Batchelder&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/442/114"&gt;442 U. S. 114 (1979)&lt;/a&gt;, we explained that each statute, “in conjunction with its own sentencing provision, operate[d] independently of the other,” such that the statutes were “each fully enforceable on [their] own terms.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 118–121.  We therefore concluded that the provisions did not incorporate each other’s penalties.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 119.  Yet, six years later (in &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt;), we concluded that the two independent provisions were also mutually exclusive under &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;.  See &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt;, 470 U. S., at 861–864.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; What &lt;em&gt;Batchelder&lt;/em&gt; is to &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt; is to this case.  Subsection (j) shares subsection (c)’s elements but not its sentencing scheme.  See &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt;, 599 U. S., at 458–459.  “Instead, subsection (j) supplies its own comprehensive set of penalties that apply instead of subsection (c)’s.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 460.  And as in &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt;, this dynamic magnifies (rather than eliminates) the likelihood that the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; presumption holds true.  After all, if offenses that share elements—as they must to satisfy &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;—have penalties that operate on their own rather than by reference to each other, see &lt;em&gt;Batchelder&lt;/em&gt;, 442 U. S., at 118–121; &lt;em&gt;Lora&lt;/em&gt;, 599 U. S., at 458–459, that suggests Congress intended to place in front of prosecutors a menu, not a buffet.  Accord, &lt;em&gt;Jeffers&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/432/137"&gt;432 U. S. 137&lt;/a&gt;, 156–157 (1977) (plurality opinion) (one provision’s “comprehensive penalty structure” indicated that it was not intended to supplement a lesser included provision).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Finally, &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; analogizes this case to &lt;em&gt;Garrett&lt;/em&gt;, in which we found &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; overcome even without express statutory language disclaiming the presumption.  &lt;em&gt;Garrett&lt;/em&gt; examined the relationship between the continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) statute and its constituent offenses.  See 471 U. S., at 779–781.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The distinctions from &lt;em&gt;Garrett&lt;/em&gt; are legion, because the justifications we offered for that decision are legion.  But, most straightforwardly, &lt;em&gt;Garrett&lt;/em&gt; distinguished “the classic relation of the ‘lesser included offense’ to the greater offense,” wherein “[t]he very same conduct” violates two statutes.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 787 (contrasting &lt;em&gt;Brown&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Ohio&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/432/161"&gt;432 U. S. 161 (1977)&lt;/a&gt;, which involved joyriding and auto theft—both of which were violated by driving a stolen car).  In &lt;em&gt;Garrett&lt;/em&gt;, by contrast, “the continuing criminal enterprise was alleged to have spanned more than five years.”  471 U. S., at 788.  The Court did not believe that Congress wished to require the Government to choose between prosecuting the defendant for early predicates and forfeiting a later CCE charge, on the one hand, and allowing him to go on breaking the law to preserve the possibility of a CCE charge, on the other.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 788–790.  The continuing nature of the offense played a decisive role in the case: “One who insists that the music stop and the piper be paid at a particular point,” we reasoned, “must at least have stopped dancing himself before he may seek such an accounting.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 790.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Today’s circumstances are markedly different. Here, we have nothing more than “the classic relation of the ‘lesser included offense’ to the greater offense.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 787.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;C&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt; turns finally to legislative history.  We have said that legislative history may “fortif[y]” a conclusion that Congress intends to overcome &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;.  See &lt;em&gt;Garrett&lt;/em&gt;, 471 U. S., at 782.  But the legislative history &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; offers pertains to double convicting for subsection (c) and its predicates—a practice Congress expressly authorized in the text.  See Brief for Court-Appointed &lt;em&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/em&gt; 26–28.  For obvious reasons, this is unhelpful data for interpreting the relationship between subsections (c) and (j).  If anything, it illuminates the sort of discussion that characterizes congressional deliberation over legislation that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; intend to authorize cumulative punishment—and thus highlights the notable absence of any similar deliberation over subsection (j).  See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as &lt;em&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/em&gt; 5–10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Rather, the only legislative history that is relevant to today’s inquiry accords with Barrett’s understanding of subsection (j).  That legislative history suggests that, rather than stacking punishment or creating a brand “[n]ew . . . offens[e],” subsection (j) (at the time styled subsection (i)) “made” a “capital offens[e]” out of a “[p]re-existing crim[e]”—the one at subsection (c).  Cong. Research Serv., C. Doyle, Crime Control Act of 1994: Capital Punishment Provisions Summarized, pp. 3–4 (94–721 S, 1994); see also 140 Cong. Rec. 11158 (1994) (Sen. Biden remarking that the new provision “says if you are guilty of committing a crime that results in the death of an individual through the use of a gun, you are eligible for the death penalty, assuming it is a Federal crime”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Like its silence in the statutory text, Congress’s debate-floor silence says a lot.  The &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; presumption is “long-settled,” &lt;em&gt;Gamble&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/678"&gt;587 U. S. 678&lt;/a&gt;, 710 (2019), muscular, and fundamental to our law.  We think it highly unlikely that the “ ‘lawyer’s body’ ” that is Congress, &lt;em&gt;Albernaz&lt;/em&gt;, 450 U. S., at 341 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Callanan&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/364/587"&gt;364 U. S. 587&lt;/a&gt;, 594 (1961)), discarded &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; without comment here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Congress has not authorized convictions under both &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924#c_1_A_i"&gt;18 U. S. C. §§924(c)(1)(A)(i)&lt;/a&gt; and (j) for one act that violates both provisions.  The part of the judgment of the Court of Appeals that held otherwise is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;It is so ordered&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-1ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; *Part IV–C of this opinion is joined only by &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;The Chief Justice&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Kagan&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-2ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  Count six of the indictment technically charged Barrett with violating &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924#c_1_A_iii"&gt;18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii)&lt;/a&gt;, which applies when the firearm is discharged rather than simply used, carried, or possessed.  See 102 F. 4th 60, 70, n. 8 (CA2 2024).  But the jury was charged with finding only that Barrett possessed or used the firearm—a violation of §924(c)(1)(A)(i), not (iii)—and the District Court sentenced him in line with §924(c)(1)(A)(i).  Before us, all agree that Barrett’s count six conviction was for a violation of §924(c)(1)(A)(i).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  In his petition for a writ of certiorari, Barrett sought review of whether Hobbs Act robbery qualifies as a “crime of violence” such that it can serve as a predicate for a §924(c)(1) conviction.  We did not grant certiorari on that question, and do not pass on it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-4ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;  The remaining five years, not relevant here, came from a consecutive mandatory minimum sentence on a different §924(c) count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-5ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;  The Second Circuit’s decision aligned with &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Julian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/633_F.3d_1250"&gt;633 F. 3d 1250&lt;/a&gt;, 1256–1257 (CA11 2011).  It diverged from most appellate courts that have considered the question.  See &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Ortiz-Orellana&lt;/em&gt;, 90 F. 4th 689, 705 (CA4 2024) (“[A] sentencing court may not impose cumulative punishments for §924(c) and §924(j) if those violations are based on the same conduct” (citing &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Palacios&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/982_F.3d_920"&gt;982 F. 3d 920&lt;/a&gt;, 924–925 (CA4 2020)); &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Gonzales&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/841_F.3d_339"&gt;841 F. 3d 339&lt;/a&gt;, 358 (CA5 2016) (similar); &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;García-Ortiz&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/657_F.3d_25"&gt;657 F. 3d 25&lt;/a&gt;, 28–29 (CA1 2011) (similar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-6ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  We appointed Charles L. McCloud to brief and argue the case in support of the judgment below.  604 U. S. ___ (2025).  Mr. McCloud has ably discharged his responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-7ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;  In response to our decision in &lt;em&gt;Bailey&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/516/137"&gt;516 U. S. 137 (1995)&lt;/a&gt;, Congress later added “possession” to the list of subsection (c)’s proscriptions, alongside use and carry.  See &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;O’Brien&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/560/218"&gt;560 U. S. 218&lt;/a&gt;, 232–233 (2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-8ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;  This too has changed over the years.  Subsection (c) originally employed mandatory sentences—exactly 5 years, exactly 10, and so on.  See &lt;em&gt;O’Brien&lt;/em&gt;, 560 U. S., at 229.  The statute traded its mandatory sentences for mandatory minimums—with no maximums—in 1998.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-9ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;  The “special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States” covers, among other things, “lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof.”  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/7#3"&gt;18 U. S. C. §7(3)&lt;/a&gt;.  It also pertains to locations like certain “island[s], rock[s], or key[s] containing deposits of guano,” §7(4), and spaceships “while . . . in flight.”  §7(6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-10ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;  Because we conclude that Congress did not authorize two convictions in this context, we need not revisit whether Congress &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do so consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 4 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt;, J., concurring in part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-11ref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;  We express no view as to whether the same is true as to other versions of the §924(c) offense, as Barrett was convicted under §924(c)(1)(A)(i).  Put differently, while we recognize that §924(c) can be violated in a number of ways, this case involves only the base offense found at §924(c)(1)(A)(i).  Our holding therefore applies only to that clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-12ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;  Significant too is the fact that Congress added the “ ‘in addition to’ ” language to §924(c)(1) in 1971, see §13, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/84_Stat._1890"&gt;84 Stat. 1890&lt;/a&gt;, and passed §924(c)(5) in 2005, see §6(b), &lt;a href="/rio/citation/119_Stat._2102"&gt;119 Stat. 2102&lt;/a&gt;.  Congress thus demonstrated its ability to overcome &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; in subsection (c) both before and after it passed subsection (j) in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-13ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;  Section 924(c) is not unique in this way.  Congress frequently gives these two distinct instructions, understanding that one speaks to the dual-conviction question and the other to the sentence-arrangement issue.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1028A#a_2"&gt;18 U. S. C. §§1028A(a)(2)&lt;/a&gt; (instructing that a conviction for using false identification during and in relation to certain predicate felonies shall be “in addition to the punishment provided for such felony”), and (b)(2) (requiring in certain circumstances that the resulting additional sentence run consecutively to “any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person under any other provision of law, including any term of imprisonment imposed for the [predicate] felony”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-14ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt; molds this same basic argument into many forms, sketching situations in which the maximum sentence under subsection (j) could, at times, dip below the minimum sentence under subsection (c)(1) (though not under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i)).  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., Brief for Court-Appointed &lt;em&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/em&gt; 47, n. 8.  But the most this line of attack shows is that Congress could rationally have designed subsection (j) to supplement rather than provide an alternative to subsection (c)(1).  It does not come close to showing that Congress actually intended to do so, much less that it has clearly indicated such intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-15ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;  We have also explained that &lt;em&gt;Garrett&lt;/em&gt; “merely adhered to our understanding that legislatures have traditionally perceived a qualitative difference between conspiracy-like crimes and the substantive offenses upon which they are predicated.”  &lt;em&gt;Rutledge&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/517/292"&gt;517 U. S. 292&lt;/a&gt;, 300–301, n. 12 (1996).  The case before us now does not implicate that dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt;, concurring in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; On the morning of December 12, 2011, Dwayne Barrett participated in an armed robbery that left a man dead.  For this, Mr. Barrett was convicted twice in federal court.  Once for using a firearm during a crime of violence under &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924#c_1_A"&gt;18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)&lt;/a&gt;.  And once for causing a death during a §924(c) violation in violation of §924(j).  102 F. 4th 60, 67 (CA2 2024).  For his two convictions, the Second Circuit ordered two separate punishments: a prison term for his §924(c)(1)(A) violation, plus another, consecutive prison term for his §924(j) violation.  All of which raises the question:  If Mr. Barrett is convicted and punished for both crimes, has he been “twice put in jeopardy” for “the same offence” in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause?  U. S. Const., Amdt. 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; There is no doubt how we would answer that question if the government had prosecuted Mr. Barrett under §924(c)(1)(A) and §924(j) in two successive proceedings.  The analysis would begin and end with &lt;em&gt;Blockburger &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/284/299"&gt;284 U. S. 299 (1932)&lt;/a&gt;.  Under &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;, two provisions create the same offense for double jeopardy purposes unless each provision has an element the other lacks.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 304.  Here, all agree that §924(c)(1)(A) has no element that §924(j) lacks.  So the two provisions create the same offense, and the Double Jeopardy Clause would bar  the second prosecution.  &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Dixon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/509/688"&gt;509 U. S. 688&lt;/a&gt;, 696 (1993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; What happens, though, where (as here) the government brings two charges for the same offense concurrently in the same proceeding rather than successively in two separate ones?  That question does not appear to have arisen much in our Nation’s early years.  Maybe it didn’t in part because criminal codes were considerably thinner then, affording prosecutors fewer opportunities to bring overlapping charges.  Maybe it didn’t in part, too, because of the traditional maxim that “an indictment should not include more than one felony,” which left multiple-count indictments vulnerable to being quashed by trial judges.  &lt;em&gt;Pointer&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/151/396"&gt;151 U. S. 396&lt;/a&gt;, 403 (1894).  But if the question didn’t arise much in the past, it is of obvious relevance in our times.  These days, federal and state criminal codes have exploded, with scores of repetitive offenses on the books.  Frequently, also, today’s prosecutors bring as many overlapping felony charges as they can in a single case to see what will stick, and courts often tolerate the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The litigants before us proceed on the unexamined premise that &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; works differently in concurrent prosecutions than it does in successive ones.  In concurrent prosecutions, they assume, &lt;em&gt;Blockburger &lt;/em&gt;operates as a mere “presumption” for ascertaining congressional “inten[t].”  &lt;em&gt;E.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Brief for Petitioner 2 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because §924(c)(1)(A) and §924(j) create the same offense under &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;, they say, we should presume that just one of Mr. Barrett’s convictions can stand unless Congress has clearly directed otherwise.  The only question that divides the litigants is whether, in fact, Congress included clear directions in §924 authorizing both convictions.  See Brief for Petitioner 18–26; Brief for United States 15–23; Brief for Court-Appointed &lt;em&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/em&gt; 15–28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Addressing the case as the litigants have framed it, the Court today holds that nothing in §924 overcomes the “&lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; presumption,” so only one of Mr. Barrett’s convictions can stand.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 1–2, 9.  I agree with that as far as it goes.  But it’s also hard not to wonder where the litigants’ presumptive version of &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; comes from.  If the Constitution always prohibits the government from securing two convictions for the same offense in successive prosecutions, why would it sometimes tolerate a different result in concurrent prosecutions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; One thing here is certain.  The litigants framed this case the way they did because our cases speak confusingly about the role of the Double Jeopardy Clause in concurrent prosecutions.  This Court has sometimes said that the Clause “ ‘protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Schiro&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Farley&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/510/222"&gt;510 U. S. 222&lt;/a&gt;, 229 (1994) (quoting &lt;em&gt;North Carolina&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Pearce&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/395/711"&gt;395 U. S. 711&lt;/a&gt;, 717 (1969)).  And we have held that multiple convictions for the same offense—even when secured in a single proceeding—count as multiple punishments.  &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/470/856"&gt;470 U. S. 856&lt;/a&gt;, 865 (1985).  From this, it would seem to follow that Congress cannot authorize multiple convictions for the same offense in concurrent prosecutions.  But this Court has also sometimes said that, in the concurrent-prosecution context, the Clause merely directs courts to ascertain statutory meaning accurately.  “ ‘The question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible,’ ” we once wrote, “ ‘is &lt;em&gt;no different&lt;/em&gt; from the question of what punishments the Legislative Branch intended to be imposed.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Missouri&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/459/359"&gt;459 U. S. 359&lt;/a&gt;, 368 (1983) (quoting &lt;em&gt;Albernaz&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/450/333"&gt;450 U. S. 333&lt;/a&gt;, 344 (1981); emphasis added; alteration omitted); see also &lt;em&gt;Garrett&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/471/773"&gt;471 U. S. 773&lt;/a&gt;, 778 (1985).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Someday, we will need to resolve the tension in our case law.  And when we do, I see two likely solutions.  One would be to say out loud what some of our cases imply: that the constitutional phrase “the same offence,” Amdt. 5, means different things in different contexts.  In the successive-prosecution context, two charges amount to the same offense if they fail the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger &lt;/em&gt;test.  But in the concurrent-prosecution context, two charges amount to the same offense only if they fail the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; test &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Congress has not clearly intended punishment under both.  That solution, though, would be a curious one indeed.  Not only would it allow Congress to permit in the concurrent-prosecution context what we have long held the Constitution forbids in the successive-prosecution context.  Really, it is a little “embarrassing to assert that the single term ‘same offence’ ” in the Double Jeopardy Clause “has two different meanings.”  &lt;em&gt;Dixon&lt;/em&gt;, 509 U. S., at 704.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; A second solution would be to recognize, as others of our cases imply, that two charges amount to the same offense under the Double Jeopardy Clause if they fail the &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; test—full stop.  So a defendant cannot be prosecuted for both charges in successive proceedings.  Nor may he be convicted twice (much less sentenced twice) for both charges just because they happen to be brought concurrently.  True, this approach would require us to admit that &lt;em&gt;Blockburger &lt;/em&gt;is not, after all, a mere presumption in the concurrent-prosecution context.  But saying that much would give the constitutional phrase “the same offence” a consistent meaning and treat like cases alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Nor would taking that step represent some giant leap.  Our cases discussing &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; as a mere presumption in the concurrent-prosecution context were decided during a relatively brief period when this Court didn’t take &lt;em&gt;Blockburger &lt;/em&gt;very seriously in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; context, even when it came to successive prosecutions.  See &lt;em&gt;Grady&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Corbin&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/495/508"&gt;495 U. S. 508&lt;/a&gt;, 510 (1990) (finding a double jeopardy violation based on a same-transaction test, divorced from &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;).  Since then, however, we have expressly renounced that approach, reaffirming that &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;’s “long-settled rule” controls what counts as “an ‘offence’ for double jeopardy purposes” in successive prosecutions.  &lt;em&gt;Gamble&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/678"&gt;587 U. S. 678&lt;/a&gt;, 710 (2019); see also &lt;em&gt;Dixon&lt;/em&gt;, 509 U. S., at 696, 704 (overruling &lt;em&gt;Grady&lt;/em&gt;).  Tellingly, too, in all the years since &lt;em&gt;Dixon&lt;/em&gt;, we have not found a single case in which the “&lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; presumption” against concurrent prosecutions for the same offense was, in fact, overcome by a clear congressional command.  Cf. &lt;em&gt;Rutledge&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/517/292"&gt;517 U. S. 292&lt;/a&gt;, 303 (1996) (rejecting the government’s argument that “the presumption against allowing multiple punishments for the same crime” was “overcome”).  In short, the analytical foundations of the presumptive version of &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt; have been gravely undermined by subsequent developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Perhaps some might worry about the consequences of this second solution.  Today, after all, prosecutors routinely bring concurrent charges for greater offenses and their lesser included variants, giving juries several degrees of culpability to choose from.  One might wonder whether affording the Double Jeopardy Clause the same meaning in the concurrent-prosecution context that it already enjoys in the successive-prosecution context would render this practice illegal.  It would not.  A jury could reach a guilty verdict on two charges that constitute the same offense, but no double jeopardy problem would arise so long as the court does not enter judgments of conviction on both.  It may not be clear at a trial’s outset &lt;em&gt;which &lt;/em&gt;charge (if any) will yield a conviction.  But it will be certain all along that, when judgment day comes, the defendant will be convicted and punished only once for any given offense.  See &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt;, 470 U. S., at 865.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Today, to be sure, the Court has no occasion to tangle with any of this.  The parties have not asked us to address the tension in our case law.  Nor does anything here turn on its resolution, given the Court’s holding that one of Mr. Barrett’s convictions must go even under the merely presumptive version of &lt;em&gt;Blockburger&lt;/em&gt;.  All this, the Court rightly takes care to acknowledge.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 8, n. 10 (“Because we conclude that Congress did not authorize two convictions in this context, we need not revisit whether Congress &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;do so&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; On that understanding, I join all but Part IV–C of &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt;’s opinion.  But while today’s decision is correct as far as it goes, sooner or later we will have to clear up the confusion—and to my eyes, this case serves as a poster child for how that confusion should be resolved.  Mr. Barrett really was charged twice for one offense.  He really was convicted twice.  Before our intervention, he really was set to be criminally punished twice.  And whatever Congress might or might not intend, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is double jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 24–482. Argued October 14, 2025—Decided  January 20, 2026&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 requires defendants convicted of certain federal crimes to pay monetary restitution to victims.  Although petitioner Ellingburg committed his crime &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the MVRA’s enactment, he was sentenced under the MRVA and ordered to pay $7,567.25 in restitution.  Ellingburg raised an Ex Post Facto Clause challenge to his continued restitution obligation.  The Eighth Circuit concluded that restitution under the MVRA is not criminal punishment subject to the Ex Post Facto Clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Held&lt;/em&gt;: Restitution under the MVRA is plainly criminal punishment for purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Whether a law violates the Ex Post Facto Clause requires evaluating whether the law imposes a criminal or penal sanction as opposed to a civil remedy.  That question is one “of statutory construction” that requires the Court to “consider the statute’s text and its structure.”  &lt;em&gt;Smith &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Doe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/538/84"&gt;538 U. S. 84&lt;/a&gt;, 92 (quotation marks omitted).  When viewed as a whole, the MVRA makes abundantly clear that restitution is criminal punishment.  The MVRA labels restitution as a “penalty” for a criminal “offense.”  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3663A#a_1"&gt;18 U. S. C. §3663A(a)(1)&lt;/a&gt;.  Only a criminal defendant convicted of a qualifying crime may be ordered to pay restitution.  Restitution is imposed at sentencing for that offense together with other criminal punishments such as imprisonment and fines.  And at the sentencing proceeding where restitution is imposed, the Government, not the victim, is the party adverse to the defendant.  Further, the federal MVRA restitution regime is codified in Title 18, “Crimes and Criminal Procedure,” and the statutory provisions authorizing restitution orders are contained in Chapter 232 of that Title, entitled “Miscellaneous Sentencing Provisions.”  A district court imposing restitution must follow the  procedures applicable to other criminal penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Court’s precedents have understood restitution under the MVRA to be criminal punishment.  See &lt;em&gt;Manrique &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/581/116"&gt;581 U. S. 116&lt;/a&gt;, 118.  And the Court’s precedents on related issues further buttress the conclusion that MVRA restitution is criminal punishment.  See &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Bajakajian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/524/321"&gt;524 U. S. 321&lt;/a&gt;, 328; &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;One Assortment of 89 Firearms&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/465/354"&gt;465 U. S. 354&lt;/a&gt;, 363–366.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Finally, while Congress intended restitution under the MVRA to both punish offenders and compensate victims, victims cannot initiate or settle the restitution process as they would if it were a civil proceeding.  The text and structure of the Act demonstrate that Congress intended restitution under the Act to impose criminal punishment.  Pp. 2–5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;113 F. 4th 839, reversed and remanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Kavanaugh, J., &lt;/span&gt;delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas&lt;/span&gt;, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;J.,&lt;/span&gt; joined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;HOLSEY ELLINGBURG, JR., PETITIONER  &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[January 20, 2026]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Kavanaugh&lt;/span&gt; delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, defendants convicted of certain federal crimes must pay monetary restitution to the victims.  That Act, known as the MVRA, became law on April 24, 1996.  Petitioner Ellingburg was sentenced later in 1996 and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $7,567.25.  He has not yet satisfied that obligation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Ellingburg has now raised an Ex Post Facto Clause challenge to his continued restitution obligation because he committed his crime &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the enactment of the MVRA.  The Ex Post Facto Clause issue turns in part on the threshold question of whether restitution under the MVRA is criminal punishment.  Applying Circuit precedent, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit concluded that restitution under the MVRA is not criminal punishment.  113 F. 4th 839, 841–842 (2024).  We now reverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In this Court, Ellingburg and the United States agree that the Eighth Circuit erred and that MVRA restitution is criminal punishment.  The Court therefore appointed John F. Bash as &lt;em&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/em&gt; to defend the judgment of the  Eighth Circuit.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/605/908"&gt;605 U. S. 908 (2025)&lt;/a&gt;.  He has ably discharged his responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; When determining whether a law violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, the Court must evaluate whether the law imposes a criminal or penal sanction as opposed to a civil remedy.  Assessing whether “a statutory scheme is civil or criminal is first of all a question of statutory construction” that requires the Court to “consider the statute’s text and its structure.”  &lt;em&gt;Smith &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Doe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/538/84"&gt;538 U. S. 84&lt;/a&gt;, 92 (2003) (quotation marks omitted).&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Here, the statutory analysis is straightforward:  Restitution under the MVRA is plainly criminal punishment for purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Numerous features of the MVRA lead to that conclusion.  The MVRA labels restitution as a “penalty” for a criminal “offense.”  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3663A#a_1"&gt;18 U. S. C. §3663A(a)(1)&lt;/a&gt;.  A court may order restitution only with respect to a criminal “defendant” and only after that defendant’s conviction of a qualifying crime.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Restitution is imposed during “sentencing” for the offense.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.  &lt;/em&gt;At the sentencing proceeding where restitution is ordered, the Government, not the victim, is the party adverse to the defendant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; At sentencing, restitution is imposed together with other criminal punishments such as imprisonment and fines.  Indeed, for misdemeanors, restitution may be “in lieu of ” those punishments, making restitution the sole  punishment for a federal offense in certain circumstances.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  In addition, when a defendant does not make the required restitution payments, the court may modify the terms of his supervised release or probation and impose imprisonment if the court determines that “alternatives to imprisonment are not adequate to serve the purposes of punishment and deterrence.”  §§3614(b)(2), 3613A(a)(1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As a further sign that MVRA restitution is criminal punishment, the federal MVRA restitution regime is codified in Title 18, “Crimes and Criminal Procedure.”  The main statutory provisions authorizing restitution orders, §3663 and §3663A, are contained in Chapter 232 of Title 18, entitled “Miscellaneous Sentencing Provisions.”  Another statutory provision, §3556, states that a court “shall order restitution” in “imposing a sentence” for covered offenses.  That provision is housed in Chapter 227 of Title 18, entitled “Sentences.”  The statute also refers to a “sentence that imposes an order of restitution.”  §3664(o).  When imposing restitution, a district court must follow the procedures applicable to other criminal penalties, including the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  See §3664(c).  And §3663(c) directs the U. S. Sentencing Commission to promulgate criminal sentencing guidelines for restitution.  §208, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/110_Stat._1240"&gt;110 Stat. 1240&lt;/a&gt;; §3663(c)(7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; When viewed as a whole, then, the MVRA makes abundantly clear that restitution is criminal punishment.  We are not saying that all of the statutory features present here are necessary to constitute criminal punishment, but they are sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  Given the statutory text and structure, it comes as no surprise that this Court’s precedents have understood restitution under the MVRA to be criminal punishment.  In &lt;em&gt;Manrique &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, the Court stated that the MVRA requires courts “to impose restitution as part of the sentence.”  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/581/116"&gt;581 U. S. 116&lt;/a&gt;, 118 (2017).  In &lt;em&gt;Pasquantino&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, the Court explained that restitution under  the MVRA is designed “to mete out appropriate criminal punishment.”  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/544/349"&gt;544 U. S. 349&lt;/a&gt;, 365 (2005).  And in &lt;em&gt;Paroline&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, the Court repeated that description.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/572/434"&gt;572 U. S. 434&lt;/a&gt;, 456 (2014). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;This Court’s precedents on related issues further buttress the conclusion that MVRA restitution is criminal punishment.  For example, forfeiture under &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/982#a_1"&gt;18 U. S. C. §982(a)(1)&lt;/a&gt;—like restitution under the MVRA—occurs at the culmination of a criminal proceeding and requires conviction of an underlying crime.  That forfeiture, the Court concluded, is criminal punishment.  See &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Bajakajian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/524/321"&gt;524 U. S. 321&lt;/a&gt;, 328 (1998).  By contrast, the Court determined that the forfeiture of firearms under &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924#d"&gt;18 U. S. C. §924(d)&lt;/a&gt; ordered during an &lt;em&gt;in rem&lt;/em&gt; proceeding is a civil sanction.  &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;One Assortment of 89 Firearms&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/465/354"&gt;465 U. S. 354&lt;/a&gt;, 363–366 (1984).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As the Government cautions, not everything that occurs at criminal sentencing or even that appears in a criminal judgment may necessarily be part of the punishment.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22–23.  But we need not explore that point further here because, for the reasons we have explained, MVRA restitution is criminal punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Amicus&lt;/em&gt; relies heavily on &lt;em&gt;Smith &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Doe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/538/84"&gt;538 U. S. 84&lt;/a&gt;.  There, this Court considered a law requiring a defendant convicted of certain crimes to register as a sex offender.  The Court held that the registration mandate was civil.  The legislature adopted “distinctly civil procedures” for the imposition of registration requirements.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 96 (quotation marks omitted).    By contrast, to reiterate what we said above, MVRA restitution is labeled as a penalty, is codified in the criminal code, is predicated on a criminal conviction, is imposed against a criminal defendant, is sometimes imposed in lieu of other penalties, is ordered at sentencing where the United States is the adverse party, and can result in resentencing when the defendant refuses to pay.  So &lt;em&gt;Smith &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Doe &lt;/em&gt;does not control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  It is true, as &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; thoroughly explains, that the MVRA seeks to compensate crime victims, a nonpunitive goal.  Several provisions of the MVRA reflect that objective, such as a provision requiring that restitution amounts be based on a victim’s loss.  §3664(f )(1)(A); see also, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., §3664(j).  But those provisions show only that Congress intended restitution under the MVRA to both punish and compensate.  And so long as the text and structure of the Act demonstrate that Congress intended at least “to impose punishment,” that “ends the inquiry.”  &lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt;, 538 U. S., at 92; see &lt;em&gt;Paroline&lt;/em&gt;, 572 U. S., at 456; &lt;em&gt;Pasquantino&lt;/em&gt;, 544 U. S., at 365.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; To be sure, as &lt;em&gt;amicus &lt;/em&gt;points out, victims receive notice of sentencing proceedings and are consulted by prosecutors.  But outreach to victims and some participation by victims in criminal proceedings are not unusual.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., §3771(a).  With respect to restitution, the key point is that victims do not have the power to initiate or settle the restitution process as they would if it were a civil proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Our ruling today does not mean that a restitution statute can never be civil.  But the statutory text and structure of the MVRA demonstrate that restitution under that Act is criminal punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; For those reasons, we reverse the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  On remand, the Court of Appeals may consider the Government’s separate arguments for affirmance of the District Court’s judgment.        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;     It is so ordered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-2ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  If the text and structure of a statute do not demonstrate that Congress intended criminal punishment, the statute may still be deemed criminal or penal if the “party challenging the statute provides ‘the clearest proof’ that ‘the statutory scheme [is] so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the Government’s] intention’ to deem it ‘civil.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Kansas&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hendricks&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/521/346"&gt;521 U.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Amicus&lt;/em&gt; contends that Ellingburg’s restitution was not imposed under the MVRA even though Ellingburg was sentenced after the MVRA took effect in 1996.  But the Eighth Circuit decided this case on the understanding that the MVRA was applied to Ellingburg.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I join the Court’s opinion in full because it correctly applies our precedent.  I write separately to clarify the foundation of that precedent.  This Court’s 1798 decision in &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Bull&lt;/em&gt;, 3 Dall. 386, established that the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses forbid only those retroactive laws that impose “punishment” for a “crime.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 386, 389–391 (opinion of Chase, J.).  Over the 228 years since &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;, the Court has struggled to articulate what it means for a law to impose punishment for a crime, and thus to be subject to the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses.  The Court’s more recent precedents have implemented &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;through two multifactor tests that turn largely on whether the legislature labels the law as criminal or civil.  But in 1798, “punishment” for a “crime” would have been understood to refer to any coercive penalty for a public wrong.  Many laws that are nominally civil today would therefore have been subject to the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses under &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;.  I would restore &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;’s approach to the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Constitution twice prohibits &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; laws.  As to the Federal Government, it provides that “No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.”  Art. I, §9, cl. 3.   As to the States, it provides that “No State shall . . . pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.”  Art. I, §10, cl. 1.  In its general sense, a law is &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt;—meaning “after the fact”—when it applies retroactively to conduct that occurred before the law was enacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The two &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses reflected the importance of the protection to the Founding Fathers.  James Iredell believed that the protection against &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; laws was “the most essential right of all,” which was worth “ten thousand declarations of rights” without it.  Answers to Mr. Mason’s Objections to the New Constitution, in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States 334, 368 (P. Ford ed. 1888) (reprint 1968).  “A man may feel some pride in his security,” Iredell wrote, “when he knows that what he does innocently and safely to-day in accordance with the laws of his country, cannot be tortured into guilt and danger to-morrow.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton placed “the prohibition of &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; laws” among the greatest “securities to liberty and republicanism.”  The Federalist No. 84, p. 571 (P. Ford ed. 1898).  James Madison argued that &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; laws are “contrary to the first principles of the social compact.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., No. 44, at 296.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; laws lack legitimacy because laws must precede the actions that they govern.  Laws regulating actions after the fact “deprive citizens of notice and fair warning and are, therefore, an affront to man’s ‘reason and freewill.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Peugh&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/569/530"&gt;569 U. S. 530&lt;/a&gt;, 561 (2013) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas&lt;/span&gt;, J., dissenting) (quoting 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 39 (1765) (Blackstone)).  As Blackstone explained, “it is impossible that the party could foresee” that his actions would become unlawful if they were lawful when he took them.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 46.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;When a man had no notice that his actions were unlawful, “all punishment for not abstaining must of consequence be cruel and unjust.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  An &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; law is even “more  unreasonable,” Blackstone thought, than the reviled practice of the Roman emperor “Caligula, who . . . wrote his laws in a very small character, and hung them up upon high pillars, the more effectually to ensnare the people.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Many believed that no constitutional prohibition was necessary because an &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; law would be invalid as contrary to natural law.  At the Constitutional Convention, Oliver Ellsworth argued that “[i]t cannot . . . be necessary to prohibit” &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; laws because “no lawyer, no civilian . . . would not say that ex post facto laws were void of themselves.”  2 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 376 (1966) (Farrand).  James Wilson thought that a constitutional prohibition on &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; laws would suggest that the Convention denied that such laws were already forbidden by natural law, to its embarrassment.  “It will bring reflexions on the Constitution—and proclaim that we are ignorant of the first principles of Legislation.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  In fact, “[a]ll the delegates who spoke explicitly or implicitly regarded an ex post facto law as a violation of natural law, and most of them therefore thought it unnecessary to include such a basic natural law principle in the written constitution.”  S. Sherry, The Founders’ Unwritten Constitution, 54 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1127, 1157 (1987).  The Convention nonetheless adopted the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses after it was urged that “the Judges can take hold of ” them if a legislature ever enacts such a law.  2 Farrand 376 (Williamson).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The lodestar of this Court’s &lt;em&gt;ex post facto &lt;/em&gt;jurisprudence is &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Bull&lt;/em&gt;, which established that the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses apply only to laws that impose “punishment” for “crime[s].”  3 Dall., at 389–391.  &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;—and especially Justice Chase’s lead &lt;em&gt;seriatim&lt;/em&gt; opinion—has since provided the definitive gloss on the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses.  Justice Chase’s definition of “&lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; laws” continues to  “provid[e] an authoritative account of the scope of the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clause.”  &lt;em&gt;Stogner &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;California&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/539/607"&gt;539 U. S. 607&lt;/a&gt;, 611 (2003); accord, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Peugh&lt;/em&gt;, 569 U. S., at 532–533.  This Court’s modern precedents, including today’s opinion, decide whether a law is subject to the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses based on whether it satisfies &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;’s requirement that it be “criminal or penal.”  &lt;em&gt;Weaver&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Graham&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/450/24"&gt;450 U. S. 24&lt;/a&gt;, 29 (1981); see also &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 2.  But this Court’s implementation of &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;seems to have lost sight of how &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt; would have been understood when it was decided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;concerned a state legislature’s intervention in a traditional private-law dispute.  The case&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;arose out of the probate proceedings for the estate of a Connecticut man named Normand Morison.  In 1779, Morison wrote a will leaving his property to his wife Abigail and her heirs.  See 8 The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789–1800, p. 89 (M. Marcus ed. 2007).  Soon after Morison wrote his will, he and Abigail had a son.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  When the son was young, Morison died.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  Abigail started the probate process so that she could inherit Morison’s property as his will promised.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  But the probate judge held up the process because he wanted to check whether the birth of their son affected the will’s validity.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  At the time, Abigail did not mind the delay because the default intestacy rules would have given the property to her and her son anyway.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;.,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at 89–90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; But later events jeopardized Abigail’s right to inherit Morison’s property.  First, Connecticut changed the default intestacy rules so that, absent a valid will, property like Morison’s would pass to his nearest blood relative, not to a surviving spouse like Abigail.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;.,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at 90, and n. 9.  Second, the probate court, without telling Abigail, disapproved Morison’s original will.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 90.  And third, a few years later, Abigail and Morison’s son died.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  After her son died, Abigail and her new husband Caleb Bull returned to probate court.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  The Bulls were surprised to learn that the  probate court had disapproved Morison’s will years earlier without telling Abigail—apparently on the theory that he would have wanted to change it after his son was born.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  And, since Connecticut had enacted new default intestacy rules in the meantime, the absence of a valid will meant that Morison’s estate would pass on to his blood relatives rather than to Abigail.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  Morison’s blood relatives, the Calders, were suddenly the lawful heirs of his property.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;.,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at 90–91.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Abigail and Caleb Bull petitioned the Connecticut Legislature for relief.  They convinced the legislature that Morison did not intend to revoke his will after his son died, so the legislature issued a decree in 1795 granting them a rehearing on the validity of Morison’s original will.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;.,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at 91.  The legislature’s 1795 decree effectively vacated the original probate-court decision deeming the will void and granted a new hearing at which the probate court could adjudicate the will’s validity.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 91, 107.  The probate court held a new hearing pursuant to the decree and concluded that Morison’s original will was valid after all. &lt;em&gt; Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 91.  Having now lost in probate court, the Calders appealed this new decision and challenged the legislature’s decree that had granted the Bulls a new hearing.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 91–92.  The Calders argued, eventually to this Court, that the legislature’s decree was an unconstitutional &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; law because it retroactively voided the probate court’s original decision, which caused them to lose an inheritance that would otherwise have been theirs.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;.,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at 92.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Bull&lt;/em&gt;, this Court gave two reasons why the legislature’s decree granting a new trial did not violate the State &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clause.  See Art. I, §10, cl. 1.  The first reason was that the legislature’s decree operated on a legal decision by a court, not a past action by the Calders.  There was nothing that the parties had done in the past that was “in any manner affected by the law or resolution of Connecticut.”  3 Dall., at 392 (opinion of Chase, J.).  “It does not &lt;em&gt;concern&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;relate&lt;/em&gt; to, &lt;em&gt;any act done by them&lt;/em&gt;.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  Instead, the decree effectively vacated a probate decision and gave the court an opportunity to correct its decision, just like appellate courts do every day.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  The new hearing, after all, was conducted under the same substantive laws as were in force at the original hearing.  In fact, the Justices seemed to believe that the Connecticut Legislature’s “resolution or law,” &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 387, was not a legislative but a judicial act, consistent with state legislatures’ traditional judicial power to review state-court decisions—and thus could not be an &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; “law” at all.  See &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 395–396 (opinion of Paterson, J.) (“[W]e may, in the present instance, consider the Legislature of the State, as having acted in their customary judicial capacity”); &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 398 (opinion of Iredell, J.) (“an exercise of judicial, not of legislative, authority”); &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 400 (opinion of Cushing, J.) (“If the act is a judicial act, it is not touched by the Federal Constitution”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The more lasting legacy of &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;, however, was its second reason.  Three of the four &lt;em&gt;seriatim&lt;/em&gt; opinions in &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt; limited the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses to laws imposing criminal punishment.  On their view, the Clauses did not forbid other kinds of retroactive laws.  Justice Chase, in what has proved to be the most influential opinion, gave a comprehensive account of the scope of the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses.  He understood the Clauses to be limited to retroactive laws imposing criminal punishment.  He explained that the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses covered only those laws that “&lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt;” a “&lt;em&gt;crime&lt;/em&gt;,” “&lt;em&gt;aggravate&lt;/em&gt;” a crime, “encrease the punishment” for a crime, or “change the rules of evidence, &lt;em&gt;for the purpose of conviction&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 391.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Justice Chase’s account implied that the Clauses did not apply to other kinds of retroactive laws.  First, on his view, the Clauses did not touch private law.  Justice Chase did “not think” that the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clause “was inserted to Secure the citizen in his &lt;em&gt;private rights&lt;/em&gt;, of either &lt;em&gt;property&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;contracts&lt;/em&gt;.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 390.  Accordingly, the Clauses would not  prohibit a law that retroactively paused a debtor’s obligations to a creditor or voided a contract.  Such laws, in Justice Chase’s view, were governed by separate constitutional prohibitions on impairing the obligations of contracts and making anything but gold or silver a tender in payments of debts.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.; see Art. I, §10, cl. 1.  Second, because the Clauses were meant as protections against the government, they did not apply to laws that retroactively made a law more lenient.  They would not, for example, forbid a law that retroactively “mollifies the rigor of the &lt;em&gt;criminal&lt;/em&gt; law.”  &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;, 3 Dall., at 391 (opinion of Chase, J.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The other two &lt;em&gt;seriatim&lt;/em&gt; opinions in &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;that addressed the question agreed.  Justice Paterson explained that “the meaning, annexed to the terms &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;laws&lt;/em&gt;, unquestionably refers to crimes, and nothing else.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 396.  Justice Iredell—an adamant proponent of the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses, see &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;, at 2—likewise thought that they did not “extend to civil cases, to cases that merely affect the private property of citizens.”  &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;, 3 Dall., at 400.  Instead, the Clauses applied only to laws that retroactively “inflict a punishment” for an “offence.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Some, myself included, have questioned whether &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;was right to limit the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses to laws imposing criminal punishment.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Satterlee&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Matthewson&lt;/em&gt;, 2 Pet. 380, 416, and n. (a) (1829) (opinion of Johnson, J.) (arguing that the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses protect more); O. Field, Ex Post Facto in the Constitution, 20 Mich. L. Rev. 315, 331 (1922) (“[T]here have been reputable authorities, both past and present, who incline to the view that the &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; provisions of the Constitution prohibited civil as well as criminal legislation”); &lt;em&gt;Eastern Enterprises&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Apfel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/524/498"&gt;524 U. S. 498&lt;/a&gt;, 538–539 (1998) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas&lt;/span&gt;, J., concurring).  Others have defended &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;’s limitation.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., R. Natelson, Statutory Retroactivity: The Founders’ View, 39 Idaho L. Rev. 489, 493–494 (2003); C. Nelson, Originalism and Interpretive Conventions, 70 U. Chi. L. Rev. 519, 578– 582 (2003).  But often lost in that debate has been the question of what &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt; meant when it limited the Clauses to laws imposing criminal punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;III&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This Court’s recent precedents have attempted to implement &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;’s limitation of the Clauses to criminal punishment.  But, in doing so, they have adopted a framework that turns largely on legislative labeling, has little basis in history, and is unnecessarily convoluted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The modern precedents follow &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;’s limitation of the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses to laws that impose criminal punishment.  Based on “Justice Chase’s now familiar opinion in &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;,” this Court has repeatedly held that the Clauses apply exclusively to laws that “retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts,” but not to other kinds of retroactive laws.  &lt;em&gt;Collins&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Youngblood&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/497/37"&gt;497 U. S. 37&lt;/a&gt;, 41–43 (1990); see also, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Kansas&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hendricks&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/521/346"&gt;521 U. S. 346&lt;/a&gt;, 370 (1997); &lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Doe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/538/84"&gt;538 U. S. 84&lt;/a&gt;, 92 (2003).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; But in defining criminal punishment—and thus the scope of &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;’s limitation—the Court’s modern framework applies two multifactor tests developed in the 20th century.  The first multifactor test asks whether the legislature “intended” the law to be viewed as criminal or penal.  &lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt;, 538 U. S., at 92–93; see also &lt;em&gt;ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 2, n. 1.  Under this test, a law is subject to the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses “[i]f the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment.”  &lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt;, 538 U. S., at 92.  But if “the intention was to enact a regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive,” then a law is presumptively not subject to the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  This test has included up to five factors, most of which allow a legislature to avoid the Clauses through labeling or semantics.  Those five factors are whether the legislature  had a “ ‘preference’ ” for “ ‘one label or the other,’ ” &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;.,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at 93 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Hudson &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/522/93"&gt;522 U. S. 93&lt;/a&gt;, 99 (1997)); whether the “codification” was in the criminal or civil code, &lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt;, 538 U. S., at&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;94; whether legislative history or similar indicators suggested nonpunitive goals, &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;One Assortment of 89 Firearms&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/465/354"&gt;465 U. S. 354&lt;/a&gt;, 364 (1984); whether the legislature provided traditional “safeguards associated with the criminal process,” &lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt;, 538 U. S., at 96; and whether the legislature gave enforcement power to an agency with power to enforce civil laws, &lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The second multifactor test, which applies only if the law survives the first test, asks whether the law’s other features render it criminal or penal.  See &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 92.  Under this second test, a law is subject to the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses if it is “so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the legislature’s] intention to deem it civil.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court has at times said that this second test is a function of up to seven factors: whether the law involves an affirmative disability or restraint, imposes what has historically been regarded as a punishment, requires a finding of scienter, promotes the traditional aims of punishment, applies to behavior which is already a crime, lacks a rational alternative purpose, or is excessive in relation to that purpose.  &lt;em&gt;Kennedy&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Mendoza-Martinez&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/372/144"&gt;372 U. S. 144&lt;/a&gt;, 168–169 (1963); see &lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt;, 538 U. S., at 97 (explaining that &lt;em&gt;Mendoza-Martinez &lt;/em&gt;factors “migrated” to &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; jurisprudence).  So long as a law survives the first test, “ ‘only the clearest proof ’ ” under the second test can make it subject to the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses.  &lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt;, 538 U. S., at 92 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Hudson&lt;/em&gt;, 522 U. S., at 100).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This modern framework is incongruous with the historical purpose of &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses.  The modern framework, because of how much it turns on legislative labeling and semantics, allows a legislature to manipulate when the  protection will apply.  Under the first test, for example, a legislature might be able to impose a retroactive $10,000 fine on some previously innocent conduct—such as drinking coffee or going to the gym—if it labeled the law “civil,” placed it in the civil code, expressed a nonpunitive purpose, &lt;em&gt;omitted&lt;/em&gt; protections for the accused, and let non-traditional prosecutors (such as a health agency) enforce it.  See &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;, at 2–3.  Under the second test, the legislature might be able to prevail by aggravating the fair-notice problems that motivate the Clauses, such as by having its retroactive law impose strict liability and then applying it only to previously innocent conduct.  See &lt;em&gt;Mendoza-Martinez&lt;/em&gt;, 372 U. S., at 168–169.  It is unlikely that a constitutional prohibition designed to curb a “cruel and unjust” legislature, 1 Blackstone 46, can be so easily manipulated by the same legislature.  See &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Rahimi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/680"&gt;602 U. S. 680&lt;/a&gt;, 776 (2024) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas&lt;/span&gt;, J., dissenting) (explaining that the Constitution does not “allow . . . majoritarian interests to determine” the scope of “constitutional rights”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The modern framework is also convoluted.  It is difficult for courts, let alone ordinary citizens, to predict how this Court will weigh the modern framework’s combined twelve factors spread over two tests.  This Court’s own precedents admit that the twelve factors are “neither exhaustive nor dispositive,” &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Ward&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/448/242"&gt;448 U. S. 242&lt;/a&gt;, 249 (1980), and need not be given equal weights, &lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt;, 538 U. S., at 105.  Such “multifactor balancing test[s]” invite “policy-driven, ‘arbitrary discretion.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Gamble&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/678"&gt;587 U. S. 678&lt;/a&gt;, 724 (2019) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas&lt;/span&gt;, J., concurring).  We should strive to avoid such unclear rules in any context, but especially when interpreting a constitutional guarantee of clear notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;IV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; When &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;said that the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses apply only to laws imposing punishment for crimes, it was  referring to an established category of laws.  A crime meant a “public wrong,” which is an injury to the sovereign in its sovereign capacity&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt; therefore encompassed offenses against the sovereign regardless of whether they were nominally criminal or civil.  And punishment simply referred to the law’s coercive sanction—meaning a traditional deprivation of life, liberty, or property—redressing that public wrong.  Applying this understanding would restore the Clauses to their proper role without the problems attendant to the more recent precedents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The English common law divided all unlawful acts into “private wrongs” and “public wrongs.”  See 3 Blackstone 2.  Blackstone titled the third and fourth volumes of his Commentaries, respectively, “Of Private Wrongs” and “Of Public Wrongs.”  This dichotomy was fundamental to English and American law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Public wrongs were injuries to the sovereign.  A public wrong was “a breach and violation of public rights and duties, which affect the whole community, considered as a community.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  Because a public wrong injured the community, it was deemed an injury to the sovereign in his sovereign capacity.  4 Blackstone 2–7.  It followed that an action to redress a public wrong was brought on behalf of the sovereign, not the victim.  J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government 7 (J. Gough ed. 1948) (Locke).  In concrete terms, actions for public wrongs were brought in England on behalf of the King, and here on behalf of the State or the United States—typically by public prosecutors, rather than privately by the victims.  The sovereign “is supposed by the law to be the person injured by every infraction of the public rights belonging to that community, and is therefore in all cases the proper prosecutor for every public offense.”  4 Blackstone 2; see also &lt;em&gt;Robertson&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States ex rel. Watson&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/560/272"&gt;560 U. S. 272&lt;/a&gt;, 279 (2010) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Roberts&lt;/span&gt;, C. J.,  dissenting) (a criminal prosecution is an action “on behalf of the sovereign, seeking to vindicate a public wrong”).  Public wrongs included all wrongs deemed injuries to the sovereign and redressable by the sovereign, from murder to mayhem to public nuisance.  4 Blackstone 5–6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Private wrongs, in contrast, were injuries to individuals in their private capacity.  An action inflicted a private wrong insofar as it infringed “the private or civil rights belonging to individuals, considered as individuals.”  3 Blackstone 2.  For example, a dispute with a fellow citizen over a land claim or a failure to pay a debt concerned a private wrong.  “[I]f I detain a field from another man, to which the law has given him a right, this is a civil injury, and not a crime,” Blackstone explained, because “only the right of an individual is concerned, and it is immaterial to the public, which of us is in possession of the land.”  4 Blackstone 5.  Private wrongs were redressable by the individuals whose rights were violated, not the sovereign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; A single act could be both a private wrong and a public wrong.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 5–6.  “The same acts will generally constitute a private injury, as well as a public crime.  A public punishment is inflicted on the part of the state, to restrain such conduct, and the party injured is entitled to a compensation for the injury he has sustained.”  2 Z. Swift, System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut 292 (1796); accord &lt;em&gt;ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  (“If one man assaults and beats another, he is punished by a fine for disturbing the peace, and compelled to compensate in money the person he has abused and wounded.”).  The private suit brought by the individual vindicated the private wrong, and the public prosecution brought by the sovereign vindicated the public wrong.  This overlap carries forward to modern law: Theft can be redressed through a tort suit brought by the victim and a criminal prosecution brought by the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; When the opinions in &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;spoke of “crimes,” they meant public wrongs.  The prevailing definition of a “crime”  around the time of &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;was “a violation of law to the injury of the public, a public offense.”  N. Webster, A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language 72 (1806) (Webster).  Blackstone used the terms “crimes” and “public wrongs” interchangeably.  See 4 Blackstone 1–5.  His fourth volume covered “public wrongs, or crimes and misdemeanors.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 1.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  The “common-law conception of crime,” this Court has long recognized, was an “offense against the sovereignty of the government.”  &lt;em&gt;Heath&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Alabama&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/474/82"&gt;474 U. S. 82&lt;/a&gt;, 88 (1985).  So &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;limitation of the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses to crimes would have originally been understood to include all public wrongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Calder &lt;/em&gt;itself confirms this understanding.  Justice Chase distinguished crimes not with nominally civil laws enforced by the sovereign, but with laws that merely “secure[d] &lt;em&gt;private rights&lt;/em&gt;,” like contract laws.  3 Dall., at 390.  Justices Chase and Iredell used “crime” interchangeably with “offence.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 400 (opinion of Iredell, J.).  Justices Chase and Paterson said that their definitions tracked Blackstone’s.  See &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 391 (opinion of Chase, J.) (“&lt;em&gt;Sir William Blackstone&lt;/em&gt;, in his commentaries, considers an &lt;em&gt;ex post facto law&lt;/em&gt; precisely in the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; light I have done.”); &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 396 (opinion of Paterson, J.) (similar).  Justice Iredell explained in a contemporaneous opinion that the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses could be limited to crimes because “there . . . is little reason to apprehend a legislative interference for the sake of unjustly transferring property from one man to another.”  &lt;em&gt;Minge&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Gilmour&lt;/em&gt;, 17 F. Cas. 440, 443, No. 9,631 (CC NC 1798).  And, of course, the occasion for &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;’s distinction was a probate dispute, where only private rights are implicated.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In turn, when &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;referred to criminal “punishment,” it simply meant whatever coercive sanction—or deprivation of life, liberty, or property—the law imposed as redress for committing those crimes.  Blackstone understood punishment to include the traditional “coercive penalties” that the law imposed as redress for a public wrong.  See 4 Blackstone 7–8.  Dictionaries defined “punishment” broadly as “[a]ny infliction or pain imposed in vengeance of a crime,” S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (6th ed. 1785), or “any thing inflicted for a crime,” Webster 241.  The power of punishing an offender was the power to harm the offender in a way that was otherwise forbidden: “[N]o one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions”—“&lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; it be to do justice on an offender.”  Locke 5 (emphasis added); see also &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 6 (describing when “one man may lawfully do harm to another, which is that we call punishment”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  The &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses therefore prohibit retroactive laws that impose coercive penalties for public wrongs.  Contrary to the modern framework, it does not matter what the legislature labels the law, where it places the law, which agency it vests enforcement with, what its stated goals were, whether it provides safeguards for the accused, whether it requires a showing of scienter, or whether the conduct to which it applies is already a crime.  Contra, &lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt;, 538 U. S., at 96; &lt;em&gt;Martinez-Mendoza&lt;/em&gt;, 372 U. S., at 168–169.  What matters is what the law does.  If it punishes a public wrong—or an injury to the sovereign in its sovereign capacity—then it is subject to the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt;  Clauses.  If it changes merely private relations, such as the rules of contract or property or probate, then it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Whether a law is subject to the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses will therefore typically depend on how it is enforced.  If it is enforced on behalf of the sovereign to redress a sovereign injury, then it is subject to the Clauses.  See 4 Blackstone 2.  If instead it is enforced by a private person to vindicate his own private rights, then it is not.  In this case, for example, the law was subject to the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses because it was enforced against Ellingburg by the United States, not by the First Union National Bank, whose private rights Ellingburg violated when he robbed it.  And the United States’s action was redressing a sovereign injury to the community as a whole, not a private wrong.  Cf. 3 Blackstone 257 (explaining that the King can bring “common law actions” to redress private wrongs to himself, such as an “action for trespass for taking away his goods”).&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Calder&lt;/em&gt;’s understanding secures &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clause protection in a wide range of contexts involving nominally civil laws.  Those contexts include civil proceedings seeking fines for public offenses.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Army Corps of Engineers&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hawkes Co.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/578/590"&gt;578 U. S. 590&lt;/a&gt;, 600 (2016) (describing “civil penalties of up to $37,500 for each day [the challenger] violated the Act”).  They include enforcement proceedings brought by administrative agencies.  See &lt;em&gt;Axon Enterprise, Inc.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;FTC&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/175"&gt;598 U. S. 175&lt;/a&gt;, 196 (2023) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas&lt;/span&gt;, J., concurring) (describing the 20th-century rise of such proceedings).  And they include municipal sanctions like speeding tickets.  “If  one were to commit a minor traffic offense at a time the offense was to be punished by a $25 fine, and the government were to then amend the statute and impose a fine of $1,000,000 dollars, it would be nonsensical to treat that fine as non-punitive simply because the offense was processed civilly.”  Brief for Professor Beth Colgan as &lt;em&gt;Amicus Curiae&lt;/em&gt; 8, n. 3.  Because all of these offenses impose punishments for public wrongs, &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt; would treat them all as subject to the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto&lt;/em&gt; Clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This understanding of &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;long prevailed.  Courts took the position that “the relevant line for the Clause’s scope” lay between “punishments imposed in response to public offenses whether prosecuted criminally or civilly on the one hand, and purely private disputes on the other.”  Brief for Professor Beth Colgan as &lt;em&gt;Amicus Curiae &lt;/em&gt;5.  This Court confirmed, contrary to the modern precedents, that “the &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; effect of a law cannot be evaded by giving a civil form to that which is essentially criminal.”  &lt;em&gt;Burgess &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Salmon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/97/381"&gt;97 U. S. 381&lt;/a&gt;, 385 (1878).  The influential commentator Thomas Cooley likewise explained that a “law will be &lt;em&gt;ex post facto&lt;/em&gt; in the constitutional sense” if it “subject[s] an individual to a pecuniary penalty” or “deprives a party of any valuable right” retroactively, even if “it does not in terms declare the acts to which the penalty is attached criminal.”  Constitutional Limitations&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;321 (6th ed. 1890).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In a similar context, when a State sought nominally civil fines against a company for doing business without proper forms, this Court explained that the statute “was in the strictest sense a penal statute.”  &lt;em&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Pelican Ins. Co&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/127/265"&gt;127 U. S. 265&lt;/a&gt;, 299 (1888).  The Court held that the nominally civil statute was penal because “[t]he cause of action was not any private injury, but solely the offence committed against the State by violating her law.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  Likewise, “[t]he prosecution was in the name of the State.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.   The Court explained that “[t]he real nature of the case is not affected by the forms provided by the law of the State”; these forms were “immaterial” to whether the law was criminal or penal in a constitutional sense.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  Thus, the Court concluded, “[i]n whatever form the State pursues her right to punish the offence against her sovereignty,” an action is criminal or penal in substance whenever it seeks to “compe[l ] the offender to pay a pecuniary fine by way of punishment for the offence.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Other decisions followed the same reasoning.  For example, when the United States brought a nominally civil action for damages based on a public offense, the defendants were entitled to other criminal-procedure protections because the action “was in its nature and essence, though not its form, a penal or criminal action.”  &lt;em&gt;United States &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Poyllon&lt;/em&gt;, 27 F. Cas. 608, 611, No. 16,081 (NY 1812).  And when a statute forbade “any fine or forfeiture under any penal statute,” the statute applied to a nominally civil action for debt on behalf of the sovereign against someone who committed a public offense.  &lt;em&gt;Adams&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Woods&lt;/em&gt;, 2 Cranch 336, 337, 340–341 (1805) (emphases deleted).  Chief Justice Marshall explained that the category of penal laws referred “not to any particular mode of proceeding, but generally to any prosecution, trial, or punishment for the offence.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This understanding of &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt; harmonizes the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses with their historical purpose.  It means that the Clauses ensure fair notice against government enforcement actions, regardless of whether the legislature labels them civil.  As &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt; has explained, today’s “civil” laws “regularly impose penalties far more severe than those found in many criminal statutes.”  &lt;em&gt;Sessions&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Dimaya&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/148"&gt;584 U. S. 148&lt;/a&gt;, 184 (2018) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).  “Today’s ‘civil’ penalties include confiscatory rather than compensatory fines, forfeiture provisions that allow homes to be taken, remedies that strip persons of their professional licenses and  livelihoods, and the power to commit persons against their will indefinitely.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  This understanding also helps reconcile &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;with its critics, many of whom have focused on the injustice of allowing the government to retroactively impose sanctions for public offenses that it deems civil.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., Brief for Professor Wayne A. Logan as &lt;em&gt;Amicus Curiae &lt;/em&gt;31–32; cf. D. Troy, Retroactive Legislation 49–55 (1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;This understanding of &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt; also simplifies the law.  Rather than making the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clauses’ application depend on twelve factors with indeterminate weights, this understanding makes it depend on a simple legal inquiry with a long pedigree in our legal tradition—whether the law imposes a coercive penalty to redress a public wrong.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Pelican Ins. Co&lt;/em&gt;., 127 U. S., at 299; &lt;em&gt;Robertson&lt;/em&gt;, 560 U. S., at 278–279 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Roberts&lt;/span&gt;, C. J., dissenting).  In most cases, that inquiry will just come down to who enforces the law, the sovereign or the injured private party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Collins &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Youngblood&lt;/em&gt;, this Court explained that any “departure from &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;’s explanation of the original understanding of the &lt;em&gt;Ex Post Facto &lt;/em&gt;Clause[s] was . . . unjustified.”  497 U. S., at 49.  The Court understood itself to be bound by what &lt;em&gt;Calder &lt;/em&gt;meant rather than by its intervening precedents that misunderstood &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;.  497 U. S., at 49–50.  Today, this Court’s precedents concerning the scope of laws imposing criminal punishment have departed from &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;’s understanding of that category.  In a future case, the Court should consider returning to &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt;’s understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-2ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  Crimes and misdemeanors were for these purposes “synonymous.”  4 Blackstone 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  Professor Caleb Nelson has read &lt;em&gt;Calder&lt;/em&gt; along the same lines: “By ‘criminal’ laws,” he has explained, “Justice Iredell and his colleagues may simply have meant laws that defined offenses and imposed punishments for them,” even if “the penalties that they prescribed could be collected through civil suits.”  C. Nelson, Originalism and Interpretive Conventions, 70 U. Chi. L. Rev. 519, 582, n. 255 (2003). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-4ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;  Sovereigns sometimes delegated enforcement of public wrongs to private persons.  But, unlike in actions redressing private wrongs, the private persons in those circumstances acted “on behalf of the sovereign” and were subject to the sovereign’s control.  &lt;em&gt;Robertson &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States ex rel. Watson&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/560/272"&gt;560 U. S. 272&lt;/a&gt;, 279 (2010) (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Roberts&lt;/span&gt;, C. J., dissenting); see &lt;em&gt;ibid&lt;/em&gt;. (collecting authorities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Dissent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;INDIANA, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;ex rel.&lt;/span&gt; DANNY W. HOWELL &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; CIRCUIT COURT OF INDIANA, WELLS COUNTY, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on petition for writ of certiorari and motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis to the  supreme court of indiana&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 25–5557. Decided January 20, 2026&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt; is denied, and the petition for a writ of certiorari is dismissed.  See Rule 39.8.  As the petitioner has repeatedly abused this Court's process, the Clerk is directed not to accept any further petitions in noncriminal matters from petitioner unless the docketing fee required by Rule 38(a) is paid and the petition is submitted in compliance with Rule 33.1.  See &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;District of Columbia Court of Appeals&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/506/1"&gt;506 U. S. 1 (1992)&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt;, dissenting from denial of motion for leave to proceed &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; To file a petition in this Court, litigants must pay a $300 fee, along with the (much higher) cost of printing 40 bound copies of their filing.  Litigants who cannot afford the filing fee and the cost of printing can request to proceed &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt;.  The Court largely grants these requests, allowing those litigants to file for free, but our openness to indigent litigants has its limits.  In fact, the Court sometimes imposes blanket filing bars that prohibit litigants from filing any more &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt; petitions in noncriminal matters going forward, regardless of the merits of their claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Today, the Court bars essentially all future filings from Danny Howell (an indigent inmate serving a 70-year sentence) because Howell previously submitted a handful of pe-  titions we deemed “frivolous.”&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Even if Howell were to identify meritorious grounds for habeas relief or wanted to bring a justifiable challenge to his conditions of confinement, he will now be prevented from doing so unless he pays the filing fee—no matter what.  A categorical, forward-looking filing bar is a questionable restriction as to any litigant who cannot afford to pay a filing fee.  For me, it is an intolerable one as to incarcerated individuals.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Court began imposing prospective filing bars on &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt; litigants in 1989.  First was Jessie McDonald.  The Court’s decision to bar McDonald made intuitive sense: He had filed 73 petitions over the preceding 18 years, several of which were collateral attacks on a state conviction for which he was no longer incarcerated.  &lt;em&gt;In re McDonald&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/489/180"&gt;489 U. S. 180&lt;/a&gt;, 183 (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).  Over the dissent of four Justices, the Court barred McDonald from proceeding &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt; when seeking extraordinary writs in the future.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Less than two years later, over the dissent of three Justices, the Court imposed another filing bar, this time preventing Michael Sindram from proceeding &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt; when seeking extraordinary writs in the future.  Sindram had filed 43 separate petitions over the prior three years, the majority of which related to a speeding ticket he had received years earlier.  &lt;em&gt;In re Sindram&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/498/177"&gt;498 U. S. 177&lt;/a&gt;, 177–178 (1991) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The following year, the Court significantly expanded the reach of its filing bar.  Over the course of a decade, petitioner James Martin had filed 54 &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt; petitions requesting writs of certiorari in connection with a variety of civil disputes.  With two Justices dissenting, the Court barred Martin from filing any future petitions for certiorari in noncriminal cases; unlike &lt;em&gt;McDonald &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sindram&lt;/em&gt;, this bar was not limited to requests for extraordinary writs.  &lt;em&gt;Martin &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; District of Columbia Court of Appeals&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/506/1"&gt;506 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 2–3 (1992) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).  Martin’s circumstances lent this Court a useful shorthand: When we bar indigent litigants from filing any future &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt; petitions, we now say that we are “&lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;izing” them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Court’s exasperation with McDonald, Sindram, and Martin was understandable.  Each of those litigants had flooded the Court with dozens of frivolous filings, causing significant administrative burdens.  In the Court’s view, a prospective filing bar was necessary to “curb serious abuses” of its docket and to ensure that the Court could allocate its resources “in a way that promotes the interests of justice.”  &lt;em&gt;McDonald&lt;/em&gt;, 489 U. S., at 184.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Even so, its decision to permanently restrict an indigent litigant’s access to this Court was hotly contested.  The dissenters in &lt;em&gt;McDonald&lt;/em&gt; worried that, in the Court’s “fervor [to] ensur[e] that rights granted to the poor are not abused,” it had “embark[ed] on [an] unprecedented and dangerous course.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 185–187 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  Similarly, to the dissenters in &lt;em&gt;Sindram&lt;/em&gt;, even though prolific litigants do cause a “minimal annoyance,” preserving their access was “well worth the cost” given the Court’s “longstanding tradition of leaving [its] door open to all  classes of litigants.”  498 U. S., at 182 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  The dissenters feared that &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt; filing bars abandoned that “proud and decent” tradition. &lt;em&gt; Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  They also predicted that what started as a rare step would turn out to be “merely the prelude” to a more habitual shutting of the courthouse doors.  &lt;em&gt;McDonald&lt;/em&gt;, 489 U. S., at 187 (Brennan, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The dissenters were right.  The Court has steadily expanded the reach of &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;, transforming what was once an extraordinary measure into a routine order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Howell’s case is a prime example.  He has filed only six petitions over the span of 14 years—hardly a flood.  Before this one, Howell’s last petition was in 2018, eight years ago.  Moreover, quite unlike McDonald, Sindram, or Martin, Howell is in state custody and serving a long prison sentence; all six of his petitions have raised claims challenging aspects of his conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Howell’s case is not an outlier.  By my count, the Court has now invoked &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt; hundreds of times to prospectively bar indigent litigants from filing &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt;.  We no longer wait for a petitioner to inundate the Court with frivolous filings.  Instead, we reflexively &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;ize petitioners after only a few petitions.  See, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;In re Nelson&lt;/em&gt;, 607 U. S. ___ (2025) (&lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;ized after five petitions); &lt;em&gt;Navarro Martin&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Florida&lt;/em&gt;, 607 U. S. ___ (2025) (&lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;ized after six petitions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Even more troubling, though the Court did not have occasion to consider in &lt;em&gt;McDonald&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sindram&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt; whether filing bars were necessary or appropriate for incarcerated litigants, we now routinely impose filing bars on prisoners.  See, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crosby&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Starr&lt;/em&gt;, 607 U. S. ___ (2025) (&lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;ized after filing a&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;petition for certiorari arising from habeas proceedings raising claims under the First Step Act); &lt;em&gt;Brunson&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Herring&lt;/em&gt;, 604 U. S. ___ (2024) (&lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;ized  after filing a petition for certiorari arising from habeas proceedings raising claims of actual innocence); &lt;em&gt;Kaetz&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, 602 U. S. ___ (2024) (&lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;ized after filing a&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;petition for certiorari arising from proceedings under &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2255"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2255&lt;/a&gt; raising ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims).  According to our Clerk’s Office, more than half of the petitioners whose filings we have categorically rejected per &lt;em&gt;Martin &lt;/em&gt;in the past 22 years were prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;III&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Applying &lt;em&gt;Martin &lt;/em&gt;routinely to bar the filings of indigent incarcerated petitioners goes too far.  In my view, such a restriction foolishly trades a pound of values for an ounce of convenience.  That is, the Court now blocks indigent incarcerated individuals from ever more accessing our courthouse, just to avoid a minor administrative burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; To be clear: &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;ized petitioners are totally barred from ever filing &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt; noncriminal petitions in the future—even to raise new claims based on favorable changes in the law (which sometimes happen), or to challenge the ongoing conditions of their confinement (which, in our society, prisoners are allowed to do).  The future is famously hard to predict.  So the justification for a permanent filing bar—even one related to the Court’s administrative convenience—is murky at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Changes in the law can give rise to meritorious challenges that a prisoner might be able to raise by filing a civil habeas&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;petition.  Consider, for instance, the &lt;em&gt;pro se &lt;/em&gt;petitioner in &lt;em&gt;Welch &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/578/120"&gt;578 U. S. 120 (2016)&lt;/a&gt;, who filed an &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis &lt;/em&gt;petition raising a collateral challenge to his sentence in light of our prior decision in &lt;em&gt;Johnson&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/591"&gt;576 U. S. 591 (2015)&lt;/a&gt;.  Welch’s filing ultimately resulted in the Court applying &lt;em&gt;Johnson&lt;/em&gt; retroactively.  578 U. S., at 130.  But if Welch had been &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;ized, he would have been unable to seek relief in this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  Similarly, the conditions of a prisoner’s confinement may give rise to new constitutional claims.  In &lt;em&gt;Wilkins&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Gaddy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/559/34"&gt;559 U. S. 34 (2010)&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;), for example, we held that a &lt;em&gt;pro se&lt;/em&gt; petitioner proceeding &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt; had stated an &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment"&gt;Eighth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; claim based on an assault by prison officials.  Had Wilkins been &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;ized, he would have been barred from obtaining the relief to which he was due under our Constitution.  Unfortunately, poor conditions in prisons across the country continue to pose potential constitutional problems.&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Indigent prisoners who are &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;ized are unable to come to this Court to challenge these unsafe conditions and vindicate their constitutional rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In short, because time moves on after a person is imprisoned and things happen, we simply do not and cannot know whether indigent prisoners who have filed multiple “frivolous” petitions in the past might have a meritorious claim in the future.  When liberty, bodily integrity, or fundamental fairness is at stake, preventing such litigants from ever again accessing our review imperils our ability to provide equal justice for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Meanwhile, the administrative burden involved in reviewing repeated (even frivolous) petitions filed by prisoners is minimal.   It is the rare incarcerated person who has the wherewithal to flood the Court with filings, at least in the way that Martin, Sindram, and McDonald had done.  Practicalities ordinarily do not allow for this, since prisoners often lack regular access to paper, pens, envelopes, and stamps.  &lt;em&gt;Pro se &lt;/em&gt;prisoners also usually handwrite their filings—a time-intensive process.  And, regardless, it is not  difficult for Court staff to sort out &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis &lt;/em&gt;filings that raise new, potentially meritorious claims from repetitive, meritless petitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I believe that when balancing prisoners’ access to judicial review, on the one hand, and reducing our administrative burden, on the other, we should err on the side of keeping our courthouse doors open.  For a system designed to administer justice, reflexively rejecting (potentially meritorious) petitions from incarcerated litigants has a cost that is much too high when compared to the (meager) administrative efficiency gains.  Nor should we forget the role that indigent incarcerated litigants have played in the development of important constitutional doctrines—and through habeas proceedings no less.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Gideon&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Wainwright&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/372/335"&gt;372 U. S. 335 (1963)&lt;/a&gt;; see also &lt;em&gt;Sindram&lt;/em&gt;, 498 U. S., at 181 (Marshall, J., dissenting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Accordingly, I would not apply the filing bar that the Court imposes for frequent “frivolous” filers to prisoners who, like Howell, seek to proceed &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-1ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;  See this Court’s Rule 39.8 (“If satisfied that a petition for a writ of certiorari, jurisdictional statement, or petition for an extraordinary writ is frivolous or malicious, the Court may deny leave to proceed &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt;”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-2ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  We emphasized that extraordinary writs are “ ‘drastic and extraordinary remedies,’ to be ‘reserved for really extraordinary causes.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;In re McDonald&lt;/em&gt;, 489 U. S., at 185 (quoting &lt;em&gt;Ex parte Fahey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/332/258"&gt;332 U. S. 258&lt;/a&gt;, 259–260 (1947)).  We further noted that the Court had “not granted the sort of extraordinary writ relentlessly sought by [McDonald] to any litigant—paid or &lt;em&gt;in forma pauperis&lt;/em&gt;—for at least a decade.”  489 U. S., at 184.  The nature of extraordinary writs not only made McDonald’s repeated filings frivolous, but it also meant that the filing bar—which targeted only future requests for that particular form of relief—did not significantly burden McDonald’s access to the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#DISSENT_3-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  See, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, Dept. of Justice, Investigation of Alabama’s State Prisons for Men 5–6 (Apr. 2, 2019), https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/ file/1149971/dl?inline= (detailing Alabama’s failure to provide safe conditions for its prisoners); Dept. of Justice, Investigation of Georgia Prisons 3 (Oct. 1, 2024), https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-09/ findings_report_-_investigation_of_georgia_prisons.pdf (describing Georgia’s failure to protect incarcerated people from violence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 24–440. Argued October 6, 2025—Decided January 20, 2026&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Delaware law provides that a plaintiff may not sue for medical malpractice unless a medical professional attests to the suit’s merit in an “affidavit of merit” that “accompanie[s]” the plaintiff’s complaint.  Del. Code, Tit. 18, §6853(a)(1).  Petitioner Harold Berk sued Dr. Wilson Choy and Beebe Medical Center in federal court for medical malpractice under Delaware law, but failed to provide the affidavit required by §6853.  Berk argued that §6853 is not enforceable in federal court because it is displaced by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The District Court dismissed Berk’s lawsuit for failure to comply with Delaware’s affidavit law.  The Third Circuit affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Held&lt;/em&gt;: Delaware’s affidavit law does not apply in federal court.  Pp. 3–11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; (a) When a plaintiff brings a state-law claim in federal court, the court faces a choice-of-law problem: whether to apply state or federal law.  The Rules of Decision Act directs federal courts to apply state substantive law unless the Constitution, a treaty, or a statute otherwise requires or provides.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1652"&gt;28 U. S. C. §1652&lt;/a&gt;.  The Rules Enabling Act, which authorizes the Supreme Court to adopt uniform rules of procedure for district courts, provides for the application of federal law.  §2072(a).  So, when a valid Federal Rule of Civil Procedure is on point, it displaces contrary state law even if the state law would qualify as substantive under &lt;em&gt;Erie R. Co.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Tompkins&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/304/64"&gt;304 U. S. 64&lt;/a&gt;.  The analysis is straightforward: The Court first asks whether a Federal Rule answers the disputed question.  If a Federal Rule does, it governs, unless it “exceeds statutory authorization or Congress’s rulemaking power.”  &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Allstate Ins. Co.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/559/393"&gt;559 U. S. 393&lt;/a&gt;, 398.  Pp. 3–4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  (b) Here, Rule 8 answers the disputed question whether Berk’s lawsuit may be dismissed because his complaint was not accompanied by an affidavit.  Rule 8 prescribes the information a plaintiff must present about the merits of his claim at the outset of litigation: “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that [he] is entitled to relief.”  &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_8#rule_8_a_2"&gt;Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2)&lt;/a&gt;.  By requiring no more than a statement of the claim, Rule 8 establishes “implicitly, but with unmistakable clarity,” &lt;em&gt;Hanna &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Plumer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/380/460"&gt;380 U. S. 460&lt;/a&gt;, 470, that evidence of the claim is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; required.  Rule 12 reinforces the point by providing only one ground for dismissal based on the merits—“failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,” Rule 12(b)(6)—and prohibiting courts from considering “matters outside the pleadings” when evaluating whether a plaintiff has stated a claim, Rule 12(d).  The court instead asks only whether the complaint’s factual allegations, if taken as true, “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  &lt;em&gt;Bell Atlantic Corp.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Twombly&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/550/544"&gt;550 U. S. 544&lt;/a&gt;, 570.  This Court has consistently rejected efforts by lower federal courts to require more information than Rule 8 requires.  Delaware’s law and Rule 8 thus give different answers to the question whether Berk’s complaint can be dismissed as insufficient because it was unaccompanied by an affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Defendants offer a workaround: They rewrite Delaware’s law.  After defendants’ edits, the Delaware law is no longer a pleading requirement but a free-floating evidentiary requirement that can serve as the basis for an early dismissal.  But that requirement could not be enforced under the Federal Rules.  Defendants concede that the absence of an affidavit is not grounds for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).  And Rule 56 already prescribes the mechanism for putting a plaintiff to his proof: a motion for summary judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Finally, defendants’ argument that Rule 11’s proviso concerning affidavits incorporates state affidavit laws like §6853 fails because the proviso cannot be read to address affidavits from third parties.  Pp. 4–10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; (c) Because Rule 8 and §6853 answer the same question, Rule 8 governs so long as it is valid under the Rules Enabling Act, which requires that Federal Rules be procedural rather than substantive.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2072#b"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2072(b)&lt;/a&gt;.  Rule 8 is valid under the Rules Enabling Act because it “really regulates procedure.”  &lt;em&gt;Sibbach&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Wilson &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/312/1"&gt;312 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 14.  Defendants argue that determining whether a Rule is valid under the Rules Enabling Act requires also asking whether &lt;em&gt;the displaced state law&lt;/em&gt; is substantive, but “the substantive nature of [a state] law, or its substantive purpose, &lt;em&gt;makes no difference&lt;/em&gt;” to the analysis of a Federal Rule’s validity.  &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt;, 559 U. S., at 409.  Pp. 10–11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Reversed and remanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Barrett&lt;/span&gt;, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Roberts&lt;/span&gt;, C. J., and &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Alito&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Sotomayor,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Kagan&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Kavanaugh&lt;/span&gt;, JJ., joined.  &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Jackson&lt;/span&gt;, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;HAROLD R. BERK, PETITIONER &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt;  WILSON C. CHOY, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;et al.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[January 20, 2026]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Barrett&lt;/span&gt; delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The cost of malpractice insurance for doctors and hospitals has significantly increased in some areas of the country.  In response, several States have imposed a screening mechanism on malpractice suits, requiring plaintiffs to submit an affidavit from a medical professional attesting to the suit’s merit.  We consider whether Delaware’s affidavit requirement applies in federal court and hold that it does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; While on a trip to Delaware, Harold Berk fell out of bed.  According to his complaint, he was taken by ambulance to a hospital owned by Beebe Medical Center, Inc., where an X ray revealed a fractured ankle.  Dr. Wilson Choy recommended that Berk be fitted with a protective boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The fitting did not go well.  Hospital employees forced Berk’s leg into the boot, twisting his fractured ankle.  Still, Dr. Choy did not immediately order another X ray; he told Berk to keep weight off his ankle, proposed a follow-up appointment in two weeks, and sent Berk on his way.  At the follow-up, Berk got a second X ray, which showed that his  ankle was not just fractured but also severely deformed, requiring surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Berk sued Beebe Medical Center and Dr. Choy (whom we will call defendants) for medical malpractice under Delaware law.  Because Berk and defendants are citizens of different States, Berk could sue in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Under Delaware law, a plaintiff may not sue for medical malpractice unless an affidavit of merit “accompanie[s]” the complaint.  Del. Code, Tit. 18, §6853(a)(1) (2025).  The affidavit must be signed by a medical professional, §6853(c), and it must state that there are “reasonable grounds to believe that there has been health-care medical negligence committed by each defendant,” §6853(a)(1).  A plaintiff with “good cause” may secure a single 60-day extension of time in which to file the affidavit, &lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;, but he must file the extension motion before or when he files the complaint, §6853(a)(2).  If an affidavit does not accompany the complaint and the plaintiff has not filed a timely extension motion, then the clerk of court shall “refuse to file the complaint and it shall not be docketed.”  §6853(a)(1).  The defendants need not take any action with respect to the complaint until 20 days after the affidavit of merit is filed.  §6853(a)(4).  Upon the defendants’ motion, the court must determine &lt;em&gt;in camera&lt;/em&gt; if the affidavit satisfies the statutory requirements.  §6853(d).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Attempting to comply with §6853, Berk immediately moved for an extension of time to file an affidavit.  The District Court granted Berk’s motion, and Berk tried to track down a doctor willing to provide an affidavit (an ordeal spawning separate litigation).  But the clock ran out, and coming up empty-handed, Berk instead filed his medical records under seal.  Defendants moved the District Court to review Berk’s submissions &lt;em&gt;in camera&lt;/em&gt; to determine whether they complied with §6853.  Berk countered that §6853 is not enforceable in federal court because it is displaced by the  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The District Court disagreed with Berk and dismissed his lawsuit for failure to comply with Delaware’s affidavit law.  See 2023 WL 2770573, *1–*2 (D Del., Apr. 4, 2023).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Third Circuit affirmed, holding that §6853 applies in federal court.  See 2024 WL 3534482, *4 (July 25, 2024).  The court concluded that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are silent as to whether an affidavit must accompany the complaint.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at *2–*3.  Where the Federal Rules are silent, state law applies if it is substantive.  See &lt;em&gt;Erie R. Co.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Tompkins&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/304/64"&gt;304 U. S. 64&lt;/a&gt;, 78 (1938).  A state law is substantive if (1) it is outcome determinative, and (2) failing to apply it in federal court would promote forum shopping and the inequitable administration of the law.  See &lt;em&gt;Hanna &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Plumer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/380/460"&gt;380 U. S. 460&lt;/a&gt;, 467–469 (1965).  After applying this test, the Third Circuit concluded that §6853 is substantive and affirmed the dismissal of Berk’s suit.  See 2024 WL 3534482, *3–*4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We granted certiorari.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/604/1193"&gt;604 U. S. 1193 (2025)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; State-law claims are usually brought in state court.  But if the parties are citizens of different States and the amount in controversy exceeds a certain threshold, a plaintiff may choose to sue in federal court.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1332"&gt;28 U. S. C. §1332&lt;/a&gt;.  In that event, the federal court faces a choice-of-law problem: whether to apply state or federal law.  The Rules of Decision Act directs federal courts to apply state substantive law, leaving federal law to cover the rest.  §1652.  Following that direction is harder than it looks, because determining whether a state law is substantive requires a court to enter “&lt;em&gt;Erie&lt;/em&gt;’s murky waters.”  &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Allstate Ins. Co.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/559/393"&gt;559 U. S. 393&lt;/a&gt;, 398 (2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Yet when a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure is on point, a federal court bypasses &lt;em&gt;Erie&lt;/em&gt;’s inquiry altogether.  That is because the Rules of Decision Act dictates that state  substantive law must yield if the Constitution, a treaty, or a statute “otherwise require[s] or provide[s].”  §1652.  And the Rules Enabling Act, which authorizes the Supreme Court to adopt uniform rules of procedure for district courts, provides for the application of federal law.  §2072(a); see also &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_1"&gt;Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1&lt;/a&gt; (“These rules govern the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts . . . ”).  Thus, a valid Rule of Civil Procedure displaces contrary state law even if the state law would qualify as substantive under &lt;em&gt;Erie&lt;/em&gt;’s test.  See &lt;em&gt;Hanna&lt;/em&gt;, 380 U. S., at 469–474.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Analyzing whether a Federal Rule displaces state law is straightforward.  We first ask whether the Federal Rule “answers the question in dispute.”  &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt;, 559 U. S., at 398.  In doing so, we interpret the Federal Rules the same way we interpret federal laws more generally: by giving them their “plain meaning.”  &lt;em&gt;Walker&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Armco Steel Corp.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/446/740"&gt;446 U. S. 740&lt;/a&gt;, 750, n. 9 (1980).  If a Federal Rule answers the disputed question, it governs, unless it “exceeds statutory authorization or Congress’s rulemaking power.”  &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt;, 559 U. S., at 398.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In this case, the disputed question is whether Berk’s lawsuit may be dismissed because his complaint was not accompanied by an expert affidavit.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Rule 8 gives the answer.   It prescribes the information a plaintiff must present about the merits of his claim at the outset of litigation: “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that [he] is entitled to relief.”  &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_8#rule_8_a_2"&gt;Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2)&lt;/a&gt;.  By requiring no more than a statement of the claim, Rule 8 establishes “implicitly, but with unmistakable clarity,” &lt;em&gt;Hanna&lt;/em&gt;, 380 U. S., at 470, that evidence of the claim is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; required.  Cf. &lt;em&gt;Burlington Northern R. Co.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Woods&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/480/1"&gt;480 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 7–8 (1987) (declining to apply a state statute where a Federal Rule “occupies the statute’s field of operation”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Rule 12 reinforces the point.  It provides only one ground for dismissal based on the merits: “failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”  &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_12#rule_12_b_6"&gt;Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6)&lt;/a&gt;.  When evaluating whether a plaintiff has stated a claim, the court cannot consider “matters outside the pleadings.”  Rule 12(d).  The court instead asks only whether the complaint’s factual allegations, if taken as true, “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  &lt;em&gt;Bell Atlantic Corp.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Twombly&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/550/544"&gt;550 U. S. 544&lt;/a&gt;, 570 (2007).  A complaint that satisfies this standard is “well-pleaded” and “may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of the facts alleged is improbable.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 556.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; By design, this system of pleading makes it relatively easy for plaintiffs to subject defendants to discovery—even for claims that are likely to fail.  To protect defendants from this burden, lower federal courts have sometimes tried to require more information for certain kinds of claims: &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983"&gt;42 U. S. C. §1983&lt;/a&gt; actions against municipalities, &lt;em&gt;Leatherman &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/507/163"&gt;507 U. S. 163 (1993)&lt;/a&gt;; employment discrimination suits, &lt;em&gt;Swierkiewicz &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Sorema N. A.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/534/506"&gt;534 U. S. 506 (2002)&lt;/a&gt;; and prisoner suits, &lt;em&gt;Jones &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Bock&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/549/199"&gt;549 U. S. 199 (2007)&lt;/a&gt;.  We  have consistently rejected such efforts.  As we explained in &lt;em&gt;Leatherman&lt;/em&gt;—which dealt with a demand that plaintiffs plead certain §1983 claims with added specificity—Rule 8(a)(2) requires “only” a “ ‘short and plain statement of the claim.’ ”  507 U. S., at 165, 168 (quoting Rule 8(a)(2)).  Unless the Federal Rules single out a claim for special treatment, see, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_9"&gt;Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 9&lt;/a&gt;, Rule 8 sets a ceiling on the information that plaintiffs can be required to provide about the merits of their claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Delaware’s affidavit requirement is at odds with Rule 8 because it demands more: A medical malpractice suit cannot proceed “unless the complaint is accompanied by . . . [a]n affidavit of merit.”  §6853(a)(1).  Under Rule 8, factual allegations are sufficient, but under the Delaware law, the plaintiff needs evidence too.  See &lt;em&gt;Dishmon &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Fucci&lt;/em&gt;, 32 A. 3d 338, 344 (Del. 2011) (describing §6853 as imposing a “&lt;em&gt;prima facie &lt;/em&gt;evidentiary requiremen[t]”); see also Brief for Respondent Beebe 23 (same).  The two rules thus give different answers to the question whether Berk’s complaint can be dismissed as insufficient because it was unaccompanied by an affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; It is true, as defendants and the concurrence are quick to point out, that an affidavit of merit is a document separate from the “pleading,” and that, by its literal terms, Rule 8 defines only what the “pleading . . . must contain.”  But we think it is fair to infer that by specifying what information about the merits is required in the “pleading,” Rule 8 excludes the possibility of requiring even more information on the same topic—whether in the “pleading” itself or on a separate sheet of paper attached to it.  Cf. &lt;em&gt;Jones&lt;/em&gt;, 549 U. S., at 205, 212–217 (rejecting requirement that prisoners “attach proof of exhaustion . . . to their complaints” as inconsistent with Rule 8).  Rule 8 addresses what information a plaintiff must provide about the merits of his claim at the outset of  litigation.  Section 6853 addresses the same issue—and in doing so, imposes a different standard.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Resisting this conclusion, defendants cite &lt;em&gt;Cohen&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/337/541"&gt;337 U. S. 541 (1949)&lt;/a&gt;, for the broad proposition that all state “preconditions to proceeding” are consistent with the Federal Rules.  Brief for Respondent Beebe 26–27; see Brief for Respondent Choy 20–21.  They substantially overread &lt;em&gt;Cohen&lt;/em&gt;.  There, a state law rendered an unsuccessful plaintiff in a shareholder derivative suit liable for all the defendant’s expenses, including attorney’s fees, and as security for that potential liability, required the plaintiff to post a bond before proceeding with the action.  337 U. S., at 543.  The plaintiffs argued that the bond requirement was displaced by then-Rule 23, which governed shareholder derivative suits in federal court.  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 556.  &lt;em&gt;Cohen&lt;/em&gt; held that there was no conflict because the state law and Rule 23 addressed different issues: The state law created a liability, while Rule 23 dealt with “disclosure to the court and notice to the parties in interest.”  &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 555–556.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cohen&lt;/em&gt; thus did not identify and exempt a broad category of so-called preconditions to proceeding from conflict with  the Federal Rules.  It held that a particular state law addressed a matter that was unaddressed by the relevant Federal Rule.  Here, by contrast, the state law and the Federal Rule address the same issue: the information that a plaintiff must provide about the merits of his claim at the outset of litigation.  Describing the affidavit requirement as a “preconditio[n] to proceeding” does not magically dispel the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Defendants offer a workaround: They rewrite Delaware’s law.  While §6853 provides that an affidavit must “accompan[y]” the complaint, defendants suggest that the district court can simply require it “early in [a] case.”  Brief for Respondent Beebe 13; see also Brief for Respondent Choy 36 (suggesting affidavit can be filed “weeks” or “months” after the complaint).  This proposal is inspired by §6853’s allowance for an extension of time in which to file the affidavit.  But defendants treat this exception—which is available only “for good cause shown”—as the rule and rework the exception to boot.  In federal court, apparently, an extension motion need not precede or accompany the complaint; nor is the district court limited to granting one 60-day extension.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., Brief for Respondent Beebe 23–25.  And defendants’ proposed changes do not stop there: They would also have us delete the provision that absolves a defendant from “tak[ing] any action with respect to the complaint” until the affidavit is filed.  §6853(a)(4).  Under Federal Rule 12(a)(1), service of the summons and complaint triggers a defendant’s obligation to respond, and defendants admit that the Federal Rule controls on this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; After defendants’ edits, the Delaware law is no longer a pleading requirement that serves a gatekeeping function; it is a free-floating evidentiary requirement that can serve as the basis for an early dismissal.  Yet even were it acceptable to take creative license with the Delaware law, there would be no way to enforce such a requirement.  Defendants concede that the absence of an affidavit is not grounds for  dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).  They float the possibility of dismissal for failure to prosecute, but that does not work because Berk actively participated in the litigation.  Defendants’ first choice is the course the District Court took here: dismissal based on the court’s inherent authority.  The problem, however, is that the Federal Rules already prescribe a mechanism for putting a plaintiff to his proof: a motion for summary judgment.  See &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_56"&gt;Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56&lt;/a&gt;.  And that does not offer defendants the protection they want, because before ruling on the motion, the court must allow the nonmovant “adequate time for discovery.”  &lt;em&gt;Celotex Corp.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Catrett&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/477/317"&gt;477 U. S. 317&lt;/a&gt;, 322 (1986); see also Rule 12(d) (requiring a “reasonable opportunity to present all the [pertinent] material” if motion to dismiss is converted to motion for summary judgment).  That defendants cannot fit the affidavit requirement into the Federal Rules illustrates that it has no place there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Perhaps recognizing this, defendants devote most of their energy to arguing that the Federal Rules contain a loophole.  According to defendants, a proviso tucked into Rule 11 makes state affidavit laws applicable in federal court even if they conflict with other Federal Rules.  Rule 11 provides that “[u]nless a rule or statute specifically states otherwise, a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an affidavit.”  &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_11#rule_11_a"&gt;Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11(a)&lt;/a&gt;.  Defendants argue that §6853 is a “statute [that] specifically states otherwise,” &lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;, and it therefore applies in federal court regardless of whether it conflicts with other Federal Rules.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Even if Rule 11 incorporates some state affidavit laws, it does not incorporate this one.  Rule 11 governs the conduct of those who practice before courts: the “attorney of record” or the “party personally if the party is unrepresented.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  It requires the attorney or &lt;em&gt;pro se&lt;/em&gt; party to certify, after “reasonable” inquiry, that the legal and factual representations made to the court are warranted.  Rule 11(b).  The sentence on which defendants rely simply “acknowledges”  that although Rule 11 generally puts the onus on the attorney or &lt;em&gt;pro se&lt;/em&gt; party to vouch for representations, “in some situations &lt;em&gt;represented parties&lt;/em&gt; are required by rule or statute to verify pleadings or sign affidavits.”  &lt;em&gt;Business Guides, Inc.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/498/533"&gt;498 U. S. 533&lt;/a&gt;, 542 (1991) (emphasis added); see, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_23.1"&gt;Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23.1&lt;/a&gt; (requiring complaints in shareholder derivative actions to be verified).  The sentence has nothing to do with affidavits from third parties.  Accordingly, Rule 11 does not shield Delaware’s law from displacement by Rule 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Because Rule 8 and §6853 answer the same question, Rule 8 governs so long as it is valid under the Rules Enabling Act, which requires that Federal Rules be procedural rather than substantive.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2072#b"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2072(b)&lt;/a&gt; (“Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right”).  The line between substance and procedure is hazy, and we draw it differently in different contexts.  See &lt;em&gt;Hanna&lt;/em&gt;, 380 U. S., at 471 (“The line between ‘substance’ and ‘procedure’ shifts as the legal context changes”).  For purposes of the Rules Enabling Act, we use a modest test: whether the Federal Rule “really regulates procedure.”  &lt;em&gt;Sibbach&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Wilson &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/312/1"&gt;312 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 14 (1941).  Or put differently, “[w]hat matters is what the Rule itself &lt;em&gt;regulates&lt;/em&gt;: If it governs only ‘the manner and the means’ by which the litigants’ rights are ‘enforced,’ it is valid.”  &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt;, 559 U. S., at 407 (plurality opinion) (quoting &lt;em&gt;Mississippi Publishing Corp.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Murphree&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/326/438"&gt;326 U. S. 438&lt;/a&gt;, 446 (1946)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In applying this analysis, we have “rejected every statutory challenge to a Federal Rule that has come before us.”  &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt;, 559 U. S., at 407 (plurality opinion).  We have upheld Rules governing the certification of class actions, &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 408 (Rule 23); see &lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt;, at 416, 436 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (Rule 23);  service of process, &lt;em&gt;Mississippi Publishing Corp.&lt;/em&gt;, 326 U. S., at 445–446 (Rule 4(f )); compelled mental and physical examinations, &lt;em&gt;Sibbach&lt;/em&gt;, 312 U. S., at 14–16 (Rule 35); sanctions for frivolous appeals, &lt;em&gt;Burlington&lt;/em&gt;, 480 U. S., at 8 (Rule 38); and sanctions for signing court papers without reasonably investigating the facts asserted, &lt;em&gt;Business Guides&lt;/em&gt;, 498 U. S., at 551–554 (Rule 11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Like those Rules, Rule 8 “really regulates procedure.”  &lt;em&gt;Sibbach&lt;/em&gt;, 312 U. S., at 14.  It determines what plaintiffs must present to the court about their claims at the outset of litigation.  Although the Rule may have some “practical effect on the parties’ rights,” it regulates “only the process for enforcing those rights,” not “the rights themselves, the available remedies, or the rules of decision.”  &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt;, 559 U. S., at 407–408 (plurality opinion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Defendants do not contend otherwise.  Instead, they argue that determining whether a Rule is valid under the Rules Enabling Act requires asking a second question: whether &lt;em&gt;the displaced state law&lt;/em&gt; is substantive.  We rejected that approach eight decades ago and decline to reconsider it now.  See &lt;em&gt;Sibbach&lt;/em&gt;, 312 U. S., at 14.  On the contrary, we underscore that “the substantive nature of [a state] law, or its substantive purpose, &lt;em&gt;makes no difference&lt;/em&gt;.”  &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt;, 559 U. S., at 409 (plurality opinion).  To determine whether a Rule is valid under the Rules Enabling Act, the only question is whether it “really regulates procedure.”  &lt;em&gt;Sibbach&lt;/em&gt;, 312 U. S., at 14.  Rule 8 does, so it governs, and Delaware’s affidavit law does not apply in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;It is so ordered&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-2ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  The concurrence objects to our framing the disputed question around dismissal because doing so “assumes that Berk’s lawsuit has already been . . . filed and docketed.”  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 4 (&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Jackson&lt;/span&gt;, J., concurring in judgment).  But Berk’s lawsuit &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; already been filed and docketed, see No. 1:22–cv–01506 (D Del., Nov. 18, 2022), ECF Doc. 1, which is how it found its way here.  The only question in dispute is whether Berk’s lawsuit may be dismissed—indeed, that is the question on which we granted certiorari.  See Pet. for Cert. i.  The concurrence reframes the question in dispute as “what is required to start a medical malpractice case.”  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 4.  But because no one argues that the court violated §6853 by docketing Berk’s complaint, the concurrence is ultimately forced to grapple with the question whether Berk’s lawsuit may be “dismiss[ed].”  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 11.  By focusing on dismissal from the start, we do not “jum[p] the gun,” &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 4, but rather cut to the chase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  The concurrence accuses us—and the “many Courts of Appeals” that agree with us—of “contorting” Rule 8 by reading it to implicitly preclude courts from requiring plaintiffs to provide additional information.  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 10, and n. 6.  Yet drawing a negative inference from text is sometimes the best way to understand it.  See A. Scalia &amp;amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 107–111 (2012) (negative-implication canon).  And while the concurrence criticizes the negative inference we draw as “inattentively capacious,” &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;, at 8, its Rule 3 analysis depends on an analogous inference.  Rule 3 establishes what happens once a complaint is filed: “A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.”  &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_3"&gt;Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 3&lt;/a&gt;.  Section 6853, meanwhile, establishes what is required “to file the complaint . . . with the court”: an affidavit of merit or an extension motion.  §6853(a)(1).  The concurrence finds a collision only by reading Rule 3 to implicitly foreclose any precondition to filing the complaint.  So if a negative inference is a “contortion,” the concurrence’s argument fails by its own measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt;, concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I agree with the Court that Delaware’s affidavit requirement cannot apply in federal court.  I write separately because, in my view, the relevant conflicts are with &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_3"&gt;Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 3&lt;/a&gt; and 12, not Rule 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As the majority explains, Delaware’s law is, at bottom, an “affidavit requirement.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 1.  If a medical malpractice plaintiff wants her complaint deemed “filed” and his case docketed, the statute mandates that an affidavit of merit signed by a medical professional (or a motion for an extension of time to file the affidavit) must accompany the complaint.  See Del. Code, Tit. 18, §6853(a)(1) (2025).  By contrast, the Federal Rules require no such additional filing.  Rather, “[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.”  &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_3"&gt;Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Thus, §6853 and Rule 3 conflict regarding the requirements to “commence” a medical malpractice action.  If a federal court were to follow Delaware’s law, a plaintiff would have to do more than merely tender the complaint in order for his medical malpractice lawsuit to be filed and docketed.  But, under the language of Rule 3, civil suits commence as soon as the complaint—and only the complaint—has been  filed by the plaintiff.  In my view, this clash warrants reversal here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As the majority explains, our cases make clear beyond cavil that “a valid [Federal] Rule of Civil Procedure displaces contrary state law.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4.  Thus, the nub of the conflict inquiry is to determine whether the State’s requirement is, in fact, contrary to a Federal Rule.  Over time, we have expressed this central inquiry in various ways.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Hanna&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Plumer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/380/460"&gt;380 U. S. 460&lt;/a&gt;, 472 (1965) (asking whether “the applicable Federal Rule is in direct collision&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with the [state] law”); &lt;em&gt;Burlington Northern R. Co&lt;/em&gt;. v. &lt;em&gt;Woods&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/480/1"&gt;480 U. S. 1&lt;/a&gt;, 4–5 (1987) (asking whether the scope of the Federal Rule is “ ‘sufficiently broad’ ” to “ ‘control the issue’ ” before the Court, “thereby leaving no room for the operation” of the state law (quoting &lt;em&gt;Walker&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Armco Steel Corp.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/446/740"&gt;446 U. S. 740&lt;/a&gt;, 749–750, and n. 9 (1980))).  But as the majority acknowledges, our most up-to-date approach to identifying the necessary conflict is to ask whether the Federal Rule and the state statute “attemp[t] to answer the same question.”  &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A&lt;/em&gt;. v. &lt;em&gt;Allstate Ins. Co&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/559/393"&gt;559 U. S. 393&lt;/a&gt;, 399 (2010); see also &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Per &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt;, once a conflict between the State’s requirement and a Federal Rule has been identified, the Federal Rule displaces the State’s requirement so long as the Rule is “valid,” meaning that it “governs only ‘the manner and the means’ by which the litigants’ rights are ‘enforced.’ ”  559 U. S., at 407 (plurality opinion) (quoting &lt;em&gt;Mississippi Publishing Corp.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Murphree&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/326/438"&gt;326 U. S. 438&lt;/a&gt;, 446 (1946)); see also &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2072#b"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2072(b)&lt;/a&gt; (Rules Enabling Act).  And for similar reasons to those given in Part II–B of the majority opinion, Rule 3 easily satisfies this standard.  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 10–11; see also &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt;, 559 U. S., at 407 (plurality opinion) (noting that we have “rejected every statutory challenge to a Federal Rule that has come before us”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Accordingly, Delaware’s affidavit requirement cannot apply in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The majority and I start in the same place and ultimately reach the same conclusion, but we have taken different paths, marked by different assumptions and nuances.  I agree with the majority that the first step of today’s analysis is to identify the relevant conflict by ascertaining the question that the Delaware law and the Federal Rule “attemp[t] to answer.”  &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;559 U. S., at 399; see &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4.  But I disagree that, in this case, “the disputed question is whether Berk’s lawsuit may be dismissed because his complaint was not accompanied by an expert affidavit.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4.  Here is why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; First and foremost, that formulation of the question assumes that Berk’s lawsuit has already been properly accepted by the court clerk (&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;., filed and docketed) and thus that §6853 is answering whether the “lawsuit may be dismissed” for want of the required affidavit.  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 4.  But that assumption jumps the gun.  Delaware’s law states that “[n]o health-care negligence lawsuit shall be &lt;em&gt;filed&lt;/em&gt; in this State unless the complaint is accompanied by: (1) [a]n affidavit of merit” or (2) “a motion to extend the time to file said affidavit.”  §6853(a)(1) (emphasis added).  The statute further specifies that “[i]f the required affidavit does not accompany the complaint or if a motion to extend the time to file said affidavit . . . has not been filed with the court, then the . . . clerk of the court shall &lt;em&gt;refuse to file&lt;/em&gt; the complaint and it shall not be &lt;em&gt;docketed&lt;/em&gt; with the court.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt; (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Accordingly, the text of §6853 makes clear that the statute’s first order of business is not to address the requirements for dismissal of an affidavit-free lawsuit such as Berk’s.  Instead, §6853 most directly answers the threshold question of what is required &lt;em&gt;to start&lt;/em&gt; a civil action for medical malpractice under Delaware law.  Delaware’s response is that the plaintiff must submit an affidavit of merit, or a motion for an extension of time to file such affidavit, because (to repeat) the clerk cannot “file the complaint” or “docke[t]” the case without that additional filing.  §6853(a)(1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Rule 3 provides a completely different answer to the question of what is required to start a medical malpractice case.  As explained above, under that Rule, “[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court”—period.  That answer leaves “no room” for Delaware’s insistence that an affidavit of merit (or a motion for an extension) must be submitted in order to commence this kind of legal action.  &lt;em&gt;Burlington&lt;/em&gt;, 480 U. S., at 5.  Indeed, Rule 3 uses the uncompromising, declarative phrase “is commenced,” plainly indicating that Congress meant for the “filing [of] a complaint” to be both necessary &lt;em&gt;and sufficient&lt;/em&gt; to begin any civil case (including a malpractice action) in federal court.  Cf. &lt;em&gt;Walker&lt;/em&gt;, 446 U. S., at 750, n. 10 (“ ‘Rule 3 simply provides that an action is commenced by filing the complaint and has as its primary purpose the measuring of time periods that begin running from the date of commencement’ ” (quoting 4 C. Wright &amp;amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §1057, p. 191 (1969))); &lt;em&gt;Hallstrom &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Tillamook County&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/493/20"&gt;493 U. S. 20&lt;/a&gt;, 26 (1989) (reading Rule 3 to mean that “filing a complaint with the court” is synonymous with “fil[ing] suit”).&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Resisting this conclusion, defendants rely on three cases from 1949, arguing that “this Court has long found applicable in federal court” “state-law condition[s] on allowing suits to proceed.”  Brief for Respondent Beebe 26–27, and n. 11; see also Brief for Respondent Choy 36–37.  But that argument mischaracterizes our past rulings.  See &lt;em&gt;Cohen &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/337/541"&gt;337 U. S. 541 (1949)&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Woods&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Interstate Realty Co&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/337/535"&gt;337 U. S. 535 (1949)&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Walker &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Armco Steel Corp&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/446/740"&gt;446 U. S. 740&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The majority has already ably explained that defendants “substantially overread” &lt;em&gt;Cohen &lt;/em&gt;for the proposition that “all state ‘preconditions to proceeding’ are consistent with the Federal Rules.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 7.  I think &lt;em&gt;Walker &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Woods &lt;/em&gt;are also easily distinguishable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As with &lt;em&gt;Cohen&lt;/em&gt;, respondents overstate the effect of &lt;em&gt;Walker&lt;/em&gt;.  There, we held that a federal court sitting in diversity must apply an Oklahoma law that deemed an action “commenced” upon service of the summons &lt;em&gt;for purposes of the State’s statute of limitations&lt;/em&gt;.  446 U. S., at 742.  Rule 3, we explained, “governs the date from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules begin to run, but does not affect state statutes of limitations.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 751.  Here, by contrast, §6853 and Rule 3 serve precisely the same function, in the same context: Both establish when a malpractice lawsuit is deemed initiated (&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;., filed and docketed) for purposes of determining “the date from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules begin to run.”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  That is precisely the kind of conflict that bars the application of state law in federal court under our precedents.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Defendants’ reliance on &lt;em&gt;Woods&lt;/em&gt; is similarly unavailing.  There, we held that a federal court sitting in diversity must apply a Mississippi law prohibiting out-of-state corporations from bringing suit in the State unless they designated an agent for service of process.  337 U. S., at 536, n. 1.  Mississippi’s law was enacted to ensure that only those out-of-state corporations that consented to being sued in Mississippi had the privilege of accessing Mississippi’s courts.  See &lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  In other words, Mississippi’s law had a broad substantive purpose and effect that went well beyond what the Federal Rules addressed.  That was why we had to wade through “&lt;em&gt;Erie&lt;/em&gt;’s murky waters” to decide the conflicts question that case presented.  See &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt;, 559 U. S., at 398; see &lt;em&gt;Erie R. Co.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Tompkins&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/304/64"&gt;304 U. S. 64 (1938)&lt;/a&gt;.  Delaware’s affidavit requirement, by contrast, is plainly procedural in scope and well within the territory of the Federal Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In short, our precedents establish that when a state law and a valid Federal Rule conflict—because they answer the same procedural question—the State’s requirement is inapplicable in federal court.  Because §6853 answers the same question about what is required to commence a medical malpractice action as the unquestionably valid Rule 3, Delaware’s law must give way.  See &lt;em&gt;Hanna&lt;/em&gt;, 380 U. S., at 469–474.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; If we accept, for the sake of argument, that the question Delaware’s law attempts to answer is “whether [a medical malpractice complaint] may be dismissed because [it] was not accompanied by an expert affidavit,” &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4, a problem arises: The Federal Rule the majority points to does not answer that same question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The majority discerns a conflict with Rule 8 by reasoning as follows.  With respect to the dismissal-related question quoted above, Delaware’s law says that such a complaint must be dismissed because the affidavit of merit is missing, whereas Rule 8 prescribes all “the information a plaintiff must present about the merits of his claim at the outset of litigation”—namely, “ ‘a short and plain statement of the claim showing that [he] is entitled to relief.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 5 (quoting &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_8#rule_8_a_2"&gt;Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2)&lt;/a&gt;).  “By requiring no more than a statement of the claim,” the majority continues, “Rule 8 establishes ‘implicitly, but with unmistakable clarity,’ . . . that evidence of the claim is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; required.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The problem with this reasoning is not that it is based on “a negative inference” about Rule 8, &lt;em&gt;id.,&lt;/em&gt; at 7, n. 2, but rather the inattentively capacious scope of that negative inference.  I agree that Rule 8(a)’s finite list “preclude[s] courts” from imposing additional requirements.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.; see&lt;em&gt; Leatherman&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/507/163"&gt;507 U. S. 163&lt;/a&gt;, 168 (1993).  But context is critical: Rule 8 does not purport to establish &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; that a medical malpractice plaintiff can be required to say about the merits of his claims at the beginning of the case, much less that nothing more than the filing of a complaint can be mandated.  Rather, it (more narrowly) addresses what any “&lt;em&gt;pleading&lt;/em&gt;” stating a claim for relief must contain.  See Rule 8(a) (“A &lt;em&gt;pleading&lt;/em&gt; that states a claim for relief must contain . . .” (emphasis added)).  The majority neither holds nor suggests that §6853’s affidavit of merit is, itself, a “pleading”; to the contrary, the majority admits that the affidavit is not.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 6.  So, as I see it, Delaware’s law—which prescribes what a plaintiff must submit &lt;em&gt;in addition to&lt;/em&gt; his pleadings in order for his complaint to be filed and his case docketed—does not actually conflict with Rule 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The majority acknowledges this “pleading” problem and offers, apparently as a solution, yet another formulation of the question that Rule 8 is answering: Rule 8, it says, tells us “what information a plaintiff must provide about the merits of his claim.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 6.  But, again, this description fails to acknowledge that Rule 8 operates entirely within a specific universe: the pleadings.  The majority’s unbounded characterization subtly frees Rule 8 from the constraint of its subject matter, allowing it to expand until it collides with Delaware’s law.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; When properly construed, Rule 8 addresses a particular (and particularly important) procedural question: “What must a pleading that states a claim for relief contain?”&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  In my view, this narrower formulation of the question—the one tethered to the required contents of a “pleading”—keeps Rule 8 within the bounds of its plain meaning, consistent with &lt;em&gt;Gasperini&lt;/em&gt;’s command not to overread the Federal Rules at the expense of “important state interests and regulatory policies” in cases such as this one.  &lt;em&gt;Gasperini &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Center for Humanities, Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/518/415"&gt;518 U. S. 415&lt;/a&gt;, 427, n. 7 (1996); see also n. 1, &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Accordingly, because §6853 does not address or govern the required contents of a pleading, Delaware’s law does not answer the same question as Rule 8.  Instead, the State’s affidavit requirement (which, incidentally, neither describes the affidavit of merit in relation to a plaintiff ’s obligation to state a claim for relief nor treats it as evidence) is an additional filing requirement for commencing any medical malpractice civil action under state law.  See §6853(a)(1) (“No health-care negligence lawsuit shall be filed in [Delaware] unless the complaint is accompanied by . . . [a]n affidavit of merit”).  Finding a Rule 8 conflict, as the majority does, thus requires contorting &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; Rule 8 and §6853.  There is no need to do so here, especially given the ready conflict with Rule 3 (discussed above) and Rule 12 (described below).&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;III&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The majority and I appear to agree that Delaware’s affidavit requirement—as interpreted by the Delaware Supreme Court—conflicts with Rule 12(d).  See &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 5.  That conflict suffices to displace §6853’s requirement.  But to the extent that the majority ties its Rule 12 analysis to the purported Rule 8 conflict, see &lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;, I think the majority has gone further than it needs to, introducing incoherence in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; While the statute itself does not so specify, the Delaware Supreme Court has interpreted §6853 to mean that (assuming the clerk of court accepts an affidavit-free medical malpractice action and dockets the case notwithstanding the statute’s prohibition) “[t]he filing of a healthcare negligence action without the requisite affidavit of merit constitutes grounds of dismissal of medical negligence claims as a matter of law.”  &lt;em&gt;Hall&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Sorouri&lt;/em&gt;, 996 A. 2d 793 (Del. 2010) (Table).  That reading of Delaware law answers the question, “What can a court consider when dismissing a medical malpractice case?”  Because “[t]he highest state court is the final authority on state law,” &lt;em&gt;Fidelity Union Trust Co. &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Field&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/311/169"&gt;311 U. S. 169&lt;/a&gt;, 177 (1940), we must read this statute as that court does, &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;., as establishing dismissal requirements for medical malpractice cases.  Thus, if a valid Federal Rule answers that same dismissal question, §6853 cannot govern in federal court.  See &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt;, 559 U. S., at 398.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Enter Rule 12.  As the majority correctly explains, Rule 12(b)(6) provides the “only . . . ground for dismissal based on the merits,” and Rule 12(d) prohibits courts from considering “ ‘matters outside the pleadings’ ” in deciding motions to dismiss brought under Rule 12(b)(6).  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 5; see also &lt;em&gt;Stanley&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;City of Sanford&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/606/46"&gt;606 U. S. 46&lt;/a&gt;, 49 (2025) (explaining that, under Rule 12(d), a judge considering a motion to dismiss must “take as true the well-pleaded facts in the plaintiff ’s complaint, . . . and [must] not consider evidence beyond that pleading”).  Furthermore, by all accounts, the affidavit required by Delaware’s law is a “matte[r] outside the pleadings.”  Rule 12(d); see &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 6 (“It is true . . . that an affidavit of merit is a document separate from the ‘pleading’ ”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;We know the affidavit of merit qualifies as a “matter outside the pleadings” for several reasons.  For one thing, Delaware law provides that the affidavit is to “accompany” the complaint.  §6853(a)(1).  A thing cannot “accompany” that of which it is already a part.&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Indeed, Delaware’s Legislature apparently felt so strongly about the affidavit not being part of the complaint that it mandated &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; separation: By statute, the affidavit must be filed in its own sealed envelope, alongside (but apart from) the complaint.  See &lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;  Nor do the Federal Rules suggest that affidavits of the nature specified by the Delaware law &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; qualify as “pleadings.”  Rule 7, which sets forth a list of “[p]leadings [a]llowed” in federal court, does not include an “affidavit” (or anything like it) on its list.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Pulling these threads together, Delaware’s law, as interpreted by the Delaware Supreme Court, requires judges to account for a matter &lt;em&gt;outside the pleadings&lt;/em&gt;—&lt;em&gt;i.e., &lt;/em&gt;the existence or sufficiency of an affidavit of merit (or lack thereof )—when deciding whether to dismiss a medical malpractice case.  Rule 12(d), however, forbids such extraneous considerations.  And Rule 12 is valid under the Rules Enabling Act (for similar reasons as the Court lays out in its opinion, see &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 10–11).  So Delaware’s law cannot be enforced in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As far as I can tell, then, there is no daylight between my view of the Rule 12 conflict and the majority’s assessment.  But far from “reinforc[ing]” a conflict with Rule 8, &lt;em&gt;ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 5, our shared evaluation of Rule 12 is, to me, yet another reason why Delaware’s law is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in conflict with Rule 8.  See Part II–B, &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;.  The conflicts analysis concerning these two Rules is based on diametrically opposed characterizations of Delaware’s affidavit of merit: The affidavit must be &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; a “matter outside the pleadings” (and thus §6853 conflicts with Rule 12, per the Delaware Supreme Court’s decision in &lt;em&gt;Hall&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;it is part of what the pleadings must contain (giving rise to the purported conflict with Rule 8).  A coherent conflicts analysis cannot have it both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Read for what they are—by their “plain meaning,” sensitive to context yet without distortions created by the task of checking for a conflict, see &lt;em&gt;Walker&lt;/em&gt;, 446 U. S., at 750, n. 9; &lt;em&gt;Gasperini&lt;/em&gt;, 518 U. S., at 427, n. 7—Rules 3 and 12 answer the same questions as Delaware’s affidavit requirement.  That means that the majority and I share the same conclusion: There is a conflict between state law and valid Federal Rules, precluding application of Delaware’s affidavit requirement in federal court.  For the reasons discussed above, I think the majority is wrong to further maintain that §6853 answers the same question as Rule 8.  And I cannot see how the affidavit that the Delaware law requires can be a “matter outside the pleadings” (for Rule 12-conflict purposes) and also part of the “pleadings” (for Rule 8-conflict purposes).  Therefore, I concur only in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-1ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;   To the extent that the Court suggests that the Federal Rule’s plain text is all that matters when answering this question, that is not what our precedents hold.  In &lt;em&gt;Gasperini&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Center for Humanities, Inc&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/518/415"&gt;518 U. S. 415 (1996)&lt;/a&gt;, we explained that Federal Rules must be interpreted not solely based on their text—as the much earlier case of &lt;em&gt;Walker &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Armco Steel Corp.&lt;/em&gt; had suggested in a footnote—but also “with sensitivity to important state interests and regulatory policies,” 518 U. S., at 427, n. 7.  The majority opinion in &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove &lt;/em&gt;subsequently criticized &lt;em&gt;Gasperini&lt;/em&gt;’s “search for state interests and policies that are ‘important’ ” as “standardless.”  559 U. S., at 405, n. 7.  But five Justices in that case (&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;., a majority) agreed nevertheless with &lt;em&gt;Gasperini&lt;/em&gt;’s approach to interpreting the Federal Rules in this context.  See 559 U. S., at 437 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (writing for three other Justices that the Court should “continue to interpret Federal Rules with awareness of, and sensitivity to, important state regulatory policies”); &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;.,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at 418 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (explaining that the  Federal Rules “must be interpreted with some degree of ‘sensitivity to important state interests and regulatory policies’ ” (quoting &lt;em&gt;Gasperini&lt;/em&gt;, 518 U. S., at 427, n. 7)).  So, under our precedents, courts must be mindful of state interests and policies when determining whether a Federal Rule conflicts with state law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-2ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  The majority contends that its dismissal-focused formulation of the question is the right one because, in this case, “Berk’s lawsuit &lt;em&gt;has &lt;/em&gt;already been filed and docketed,” and “we granted certiorari” on the question “whether Berk’s lawsuit may be dismissed.”  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4, n. 1.  That argument conflates the question presented with the “question” that, under &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt;, is supposed to serve as the linchpin of our conflict analysis.  559 U. S., at 401.  The latter comes not from the facts of the case, but rather from our interpretations of the potentially conflicting state law and Federal Rule.  So, while it may be that the &lt;em&gt;question presented&lt;/em&gt; is “whether Berk’s lawsuit may be dismissed,” the relevant question for our &lt;em&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/em&gt; analysis is “what is required to start a medical malpractice case,” because that is the question that §6853 and, as it happens, Rule 3, “attemp[t] to answer,” &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 399&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Nor is the majority correct that, regardless, I am “ultimately forced to grapple with the question whether Berk’s lawsuit may be ‘dismiss[ed].’ ”   &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 4, n. 1 (alteration in original).  As I stated above, §6853’s conflict with Rule 3 is enough to hold that the law cannot apply in federal court.  And, as I have shown, the Rule 3 analysis is about the commencement of the action, not its dismissal.  Once we determine that §6853 and Rule 3 answer the same commencement-related question, §6853 cannot apply in federal court, meaning that Berk’s lawsuit cannot be thwarted for failure to satisfy the requirements of that state law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  Proving this point, another provision of the Delaware law, §6853(a)(4), provides that a defendant is “not required to take any action with respect to the complaint . . . until 20 days after plaintiff has filed the affidavit.”  Under the Federal Rules, however, the deadline for a responsive act by the defendant is anchored to the filing of the complaint.  See &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_4#rule_4_m) "&gt;Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 4(m) &lt;/a&gt;(a plaintiff must serve the complaint and summons “within 90 days after the complaint is filed”) and 12(a)(1)(A)(i) (a defendant “must serve an answer . . . within 21 days after being served with the summons and complaint”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-4ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;  The majority’s description of Rule 8’s work is inaccurate even if confined to the universe of pleadings.  Rule 8 does not “addres[s] &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; information a plaintiff must provide about the merits of his claim” in the pleadings.  &lt;em&gt;Ante,&lt;/em&gt; at 6 (emphasis added).  Instead, with respect to a pleading that states a claim for relief (as opposed to one that does not, see Rule 7), Rule 8 governs &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; a plaintiff must say concerning his claim.  Rule 8’s primary purpose is to install a “simplified pleading system” that requires a complaint to include nothing more than “ ‘short and plain statement[s]’ ” of the claim, the grounds for jurisdiction, and the relief sought.  &lt;em&gt;Swierkiewicz&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Sorema N. A.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/534/506"&gt;534 U. S. 506&lt;/a&gt;, 512, 514 (2002).  In other words, Rule 8’s innovation is the “short and plain” bit, not the substance of what is required to be stated in that manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-5ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;  The answer, under the Rule, is (1) “a short and plain statement of the grounds for . . . jurisdiction,” (2) “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” and (3) “a demand for the relief sought.”  Rule 8(a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-6ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  To be sure, many Courts of Appeals have also relied on a conflict with Rule 8 to hold that state affidavit-of-merit laws like Delaware’s do not apply in federal court.  See &lt;em&gt;Albright&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Christensen&lt;/em&gt;, 24 F. 4th 1039, 1048–1049 (CA6 2022); &lt;em&gt;Gallivan&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/943_F.3d_291"&gt;943 F. 3d 291&lt;/a&gt;, 293 (CA6 2019); &lt;em&gt;Pledger&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Lynch&lt;/em&gt;, 5 F. 4th 511, 519 (CA4 2021); &lt;em&gt;Young&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/942_F.3d_349"&gt;942 F. 3d 349&lt;/a&gt;, 351 (CA7 2019).  But a closer look at the relevant cases reveals that these courts, like the majority, got there by manipulating the relevant question.  In &lt;em&gt;Gallivan&lt;/em&gt;, for example, the Sixth Circuit posed as the pertinent question: “[D]oes someone need an affidavit of merit to state a claim for medical negligence?”  &lt;a href="/rio/citation/943_F.3d_293"&gt;943 F. 3d, at 293&lt;/a&gt;.  This leading question not only ignores (as the majority does) that Rule 8 is solely about “pleadings,” but, worse, also preordains a conflict by naming the very thing that the state law requires but the Federal Rule does not (&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;., an affidavit).  The Fourth and Seventh Circuits make the same error.  See &lt;em&gt;Pledger&lt;/em&gt;, 5 F. 4th, at 519 (asking “whether a medical malpractice plaintiff must provide pre-suit expert support for his claim”); &lt;em&gt;Young&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/942_F.3d_351"&gt;942 F. 3d, at 351&lt;/a&gt; (asking whether Rule 8 “require[s] attachments”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#CONCUR_5-7ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;  To be sure, plaintiffs can, in limited contexts, “incorporat[e]” certain documents “into the complaint by reference.”  &lt;em&gt;Tellabs, Inc.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;MakorIssues &amp;amp; Rights, Ltd.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/551/308"&gt;551 U. S. 308&lt;/a&gt;, 322 (2007).  But the affidavit of merit is not such a document because its content is neither discoverable nor admissible.  See §6853(d).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 24–808. Argued November 4, 2025—Decided January 20, 2026&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The question in this case is whether &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_60#rule_60_c_1"&gt;Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(c)(1)&lt;/a&gt;’s requirement that parties make Rule 60(b) motions within a “reasonable time” applies to a motion seeking relief from an allegedly void judgment under Rule 60(b)(4).  Vista-Pro Automotive, LLC, entered bankruptcy in 2014 and initiated adversarial proceedings against Coney Island Auto Parts Unlimited, Inc., to collect $50,000 in allegedly unpaid invoices.  Vista-Pro attempted to serve process on Coney Island by mail but purportedly failed to comply with &lt;a href="/rules/frbp/rule_7004#rule_7004_b_3"&gt;Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7004(b)(3)&lt;/a&gt;’s mail-service requirements.  Coney Island did not file an answer, and the Bankruptcy Court entered a default judgment.  Over the next six years, Vista-Pro’s bankruptcy trustee attempted to enforce the judgment.  These efforts bore fruit in 2021 when a marshal seized funds from Coney Island’s bank account in satisfaction of the judgment.  Coney Island filed a motion to vacate the judgment under &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_60"&gt;Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that Vista-Pro’s failure to make proper service rendered the judgment void.  The Bankruptcy Court denied relief, holding that Coney Island failed to abide by Rule 60’s requirement that parties make motions for relief within a “reasonable time.”  The District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Held&lt;/em&gt;: Rule 60(c)(1)’s reasonable-time limit applies to a motion alleging that a judgment is void under Rule 60(b)(4).  Pp. 2–6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; (a) The plain text of Rule 60(c)(1) provides that a “motion under Rule 60(b) must be made within a reasonable time,” and because a motion  for relief from an allegedly void judgment is a “motion under Rule 60(b),” the reasonable-time limit applies.  The structure of Rule 60 confirms the plain-text interpretation.  Rule 60 expressly modifies the default reasonable-time limit, imposing a one-year limit on Rule 60(b) motions alleging mistakes, new evidence, or fraud.  Yet the Rule does not include an analogous unlimited-time principle for motions alleging voidness.  Pp. 2–3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; (b) The Court rejects the argument that because a “void judgment is a legal nullity,” &lt;em&gt;United Student Aid Funds, Inc.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Espinosa&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/559/260"&gt;559 U. S. 260&lt;/a&gt;, 270, no time limit should apply.  Even if the passage of time cannot cure voidness, the same principle holds true for most legal errors, yet statutes and rules routinely limit the time during which a party can seek relief from a judgment infected by error.  A party would need to show that some principle of law, such as the Due Process Clause, gives a party the right to allege voidness at any time, but Coney Island disclaims any such argument, and the Court cannot divine any such principle.  Allowing parties to allege voidness at any time would have extreme implications, such as allowing parties to ignore deadlines for filing notices of appeal or petitions for certiorari when subject-matter jurisdiction is contested.  The possibility that improper service is different from other legal errors because a party might not learn about proceedings until long after judgment issues does not help Coney Island.  Rule 60(c)(1) accommodates such a scenario by imposing a reasonable-time requirement rather than a fixed time limit.  In the context of a default judgment, it might be reasonable for a defendant not to seek relief before learning about a plaintiff’s attempted enforcement.  Pp. 3–5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; (c) The Court rejects Coney Island’s argument that courts have historically allowed litigants to seek relief from void judgments at any time.  No such historical consensus exists, and in any event, for Rule 60(b) motions, the Rule’s text and structure take priority over historical practice.  The Court also rejects Coney Island’s reliance on &lt;em&gt;Insurance Corp. of Ireland&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/456/694"&gt;456 U. S. 694&lt;/a&gt;, as that case undermines Coney Island’s plea for no time limits.  Lastly, the Court rejects Coney Island’s invocation of policy concerns, Rule 60’s drafting history, and the canon of constitutional avoidance.  To the extent that these interpretive tools carry any weight, they do so only when a Rule’s language is ambiguous.  Pp. 5–6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;109 F. 4th 438, affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Alito&lt;/span&gt;, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Roberts&lt;/span&gt;, C. J., and &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Thomas&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Kagan&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Gorsuch&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Kavanaugh&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Barrett&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Jackson&lt;/span&gt;, JJ., joined.  &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt;, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;CONEY ISLAND AUTO PARTS UNLIMITED, INC., PETITIONER &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; JEANNE ANN BURTON, CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE FOR VISTA-PRO AUTOMOTIVE, LLC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[January 20, 2026]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Alito&lt;/span&gt; delivered the opinion of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; A party seeking relief from an allegedly void judgment may file a motion under &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_60#rule_60_b_4"&gt;Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4)&lt;/a&gt;.  Rule 60(c)(1) requires parties to make Rule 60(b) motions within a “reasonable time.”  We hold that this time limit applies to a motion alleging that a judgment is void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Vista-Pro Automotive, LLC, entered bankruptcy in 2014.  As part of its bankruptcy litigation, Vista-Pro initiated adversarial proceedings against Coney Island Auto Parts Unlimited, Inc., to collect $50,000 in allegedly unpaid invoices.  Vista-Pro attempted to serve process on Coney Island by mail, but in doing so, it purportedly failed to comply with the mail-service requirements in &lt;a href="/rules/frbp/rule_7004#rule_7004_b_3"&gt;Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7004(b)(3)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Coney Island did not file an answer in the adversarial proceedings, and the Bankruptcy Court entered a default judgment against the company in 2015.  Over the next six years, Vista-Pro’s bankruptcy trustee attempted to enforce  that judgment against Coney Island.  As part of these efforts, the trustee sent a demand letter to the company’s CEO in April 2016.  Lower courts concluded that this letter gave Coney Island notice of the judgment and the trustee’s enforcement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; These efforts bore fruit in 2021 when a marshal seized funds from Coney Island’s bank account in satisfaction of the judgment.  In response, Coney Island filed a motion to vacate the judgment under &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_60"&gt;Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60&lt;/a&gt;.  According to Coney Island, Vista-Pro’s failure to make proper service rendered the judgment void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Bankruptcy Court denied relief.  It held that Coney Island failed to abide by Rule 60’s requirement that parties make motions for relief within a “reasonable time.”  The District Court and Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  We granted certiorari&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to resolve a split of authority on whether Rule 60’s reasonable-time limit applies to motions seeking relief from allegedly void judgments.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  605 U. S. ___ (2025).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_60"&gt;Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60&lt;/a&gt; permits a court to “relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, order, or proceeding,” and subdivision (b)(4) specifically authorizes a court to  grant relief from a “void” judgment.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Parties may seek relief under Rule 60 by filing a motion with the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Rule 60 also imposes a time limit for such motions.  Rule 60(c)(1) provides that a “motion under Rule 60(b) must be made within a reasonable time.”  Because a motion for relief from an allegedly void judgment is a “motion under Rule 60(b),” the reasonable-time limit applies.  Accord, &lt;em&gt;Kemp&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/528"&gt;596 U. S. 528&lt;/a&gt;, 533 (2022) (“All [Rule 60(b) motions] must be filed ‘within a reasonable time’ ”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The structure of Rule 60 confirms what the plain text of subdivision (c)(1) provides.  When Rule 60 modifies the default reasonable-time limit, it does so expressly.  For example, Rule 60(c)(1) imposes a 1-year limit on Rule 60(b) motions alleging mistakes, new evidence, or fraud.  Thus, one would expect Rule 60 to include an analogous provision if a special, unlimited-time principle applied to motions alleging voidness.  Cf.&lt;em&gt; Kemp&lt;/em&gt;, 596 U. S., at 534–535.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But the Rule does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Coney Island, several Courts of Appeals, and a promi- nent treatise nonetheless maintain that Rule 60(c)(1)’s  reasonable-time limit does not apply to motions alleging voidness.  See n. 1, &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt;; 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp;amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2862, pp. 431–433 (3d ed. 2012).  These authorities acknowledge that their interpretation clashes with Rule 60’s text.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Sea-Land Serv.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Inc.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Ceramica Europa II&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Inc&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;a href="/rio/citation/160_F.3d_849"&gt;160 F. 3d 849&lt;/a&gt;, 852 (CA1 1998).  But relying on the generally accepted maxim that a “void judgment is a legal nullity,” &lt;em&gt;United Student Aid Funds, Inc.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Espinosa&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/559/260"&gt;559 U. S. 260&lt;/a&gt;, 270 (2010), they argue that the passage of time cannot turn such a nullity into an enforceable judgment.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Austin &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Smith&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/rio/citation/312_F.2d_337"&gt;312 F. 2d 337&lt;/a&gt;, 343 (CADC 1962).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  This argument cannot bear the weight that Coney Island and others have placed on it.  Even if the passage of time cannot cure voidness, the same principle holds true for most legal errors.  Nevertheless, statutes and rules routinely limit the time during which a party can seek relief from a judgment infected by error.  Therefore, a party in Coney Island’s position would need to show that some principle of law, such as the Due Process Clause, gives a party the right to allege voidness at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Coney Island disclaims any such argument, and we cannot divine any principle requiring courts to keep their doors perpetually open to allegations of voidness.  Giving a party a “reasonable” time to seek relief from an allegedly void judgment may well be all that due process demands.  By contrast, the argument that a party may allege voidness at any time, if taken to its logical conclusion, would have extreme implications.  For example, if a federal district court erroneously concluded that it possessed subject-matter jurisdiction and proceeded to enter a judgment, the adversely affected party could wait as long as it wanted before filing a notice of appeal.  But see &lt;a href="/rules/frap/rule_4#rule_4_a_1"&gt;Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)&lt;/a&gt;.  Similarly, if a federal court of appeals erroneously asserted subject-matter jurisdiction, the adversely affected party would not be required to comply with the deadline for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari imposed by this Court’s Rule 13.  It is hard to accept the proposition that due process requires such a regime.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  Coney Island maintains that the alleged defect in this&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;case—failure to perform proper service—is different from other legal errors that might render a judgment void.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Coney Island emphasizes that when a party does not receive proper service, it might not learn about the proceedings until long after the judgment issues.  But this possibility does not help Coney Island’s position.  Rule 60(c)(1) accommodates such a scenario by imposing a reasonable-time requirement, rather than a fixed time limit.  And in the context of a default judgment, it might be reasonable for a defendant not to seek relief before learning about a plaintiff ’s attempted enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Coney Island separately contends that courts have historically allowed litigants to seek relief from void judgments at any time.  But the historical record is not so clear.  To be sure, courts have granted relief from void judgments long after their entry, especially when the issuing court lacked jurisdiction over the defendant.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Harris&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hardeman&lt;/em&gt;, 14 How. 334, 338, 344–346 (1853) (affirming a lower court order that set aside a judgment 11 years after its issuance where the plaintiff did not make proper service and the defendant did not appear).  But there was no historical consensus that a party could request such relief at &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;time.  Some courts, for instance, concluded that laches or other time limits could bar relief, even when a litigant alleged voidness.  &lt;em&gt;E.g&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Stocking &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Hanson&lt;/em&gt;, 35 Minn. 207, 211–212, 28 N. W. 507, 507–508 (1886); &lt;em&gt;Smith &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Jones&lt;/em&gt;, 174 Cal. 513, 515–517, 163 P. 890, 890–892 (1917).  In any event, for Rule 60(b) motions, the Rule’s “text and structure” take priority over historical practice.&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  See &lt;em&gt;Honeycutt&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/581/443"&gt;581 U. S. 443&lt;/a&gt;, 453 (2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  Coney Island turns next to this Court’s decision in &lt;em&gt;Insurance Corp. of Ireland&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/456/694"&gt;456 U. S. 694 (1982)&lt;/a&gt;.  There, we explained that a defendant seeking to dispute personal jurisdiction is “always free to ignore the judicial proceedings, risk a default judgment, and then challenge that judgment . . . in a collateral proceeding.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 706.  Citing this sentence, Coney Island argues that defendants need not comply with time limits when alleging a lack of personal jurisdiction.  But &lt;em&gt;Insurance Corp&lt;/em&gt;. also recognized that the “expression of legal rights is often subject to certain procedural rules,” and “the failure to enter a timely objection” may result in the loss of a legal right.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 705.  Thus, &lt;em&gt;Insurance Corp.&lt;/em&gt; undermines Coney Island’s plea for no time limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Coney Island lastly invokes policy concerns, Rule 60’s drafting history, and the canon of constitutional avoidance.  To the extent that these interpretive tools carry any weight, they do so only when a Rule’s language is ambiguous.  See &lt;em&gt;BP p.l.c.&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Mayor and City Council of Baltimore&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/593/230"&gt;593 U. S. 230&lt;/a&gt;, 245 (2021); &lt;em&gt;Milner&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Department of Navy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/562"&gt;562 U. S. 562&lt;/a&gt;, 572 (2011); &lt;em&gt;Van Buren&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/593/374"&gt;593 U. S. 374&lt;/a&gt;, 393–394 (2021).  Here, the operative language clearly requires parties to make Rule 60(b) motions within a reasonable time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;III&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Litigants seeking relief under Rule 60(b)(4) must comply with Rule 60(c)(1) and file a motion within a reasonable time.  Coney Island does not contend that it complied with this requirement.  Therefore, we need not expound on whether Coney Island’s timing was reasonable.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt; It is so ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-3ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  Rule 60 governs motions to set aside default judgments, &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_55#rule_55_c"&gt;Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 55(c)&lt;/a&gt;, including those issued in bankruptcy proceedings, Fed. Rules Bkrtcy. Proc. 7055 and 9024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-4ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt; contends that we should abstain from addressing any potential due-process considerations.  &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment).  Although Coney Island disclaims any constitutional argument, it cites a longstanding consensus of authority holding that a party may allege voidness at any time despite the contrary language in Rule 60.  And the only possible basis for such a holding is a rule of constitutional law that prevents the imposition of the Rule’s reasonable-time requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-5ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;  We express no view on whether the allegedly defective service in this case would render the judgment void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#OPINION_4-6ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  Rule 60(d) preserves parties’ ability to obtain relief from a judgment in limited ways other than through a Rule 60(b) motion.  We express no view regarding the limits applicable to obtaining relief through one of those methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Justice Sotomayor&lt;/span&gt;, concurring in the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The Court today rightly holds that a Rule 60(b)(4) motion to set aside a default judgment that is void for lack of personal jurisdiction must be made “within a reasonable time.”  &lt;a href="/rules/frcp/rule_60#rule_60_c_1"&gt;Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(c)(1)&lt;/a&gt;.  Rule 60’s text and structure require that conclusion, as the majority explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; I concur in the judgment because the majority unnecessarily opines on the potential validity of a constitutional challenge to the “reasonable time” limit under the Due Process Clause.  &lt;em&gt;Ante&lt;/em&gt;, at 4.  Coney Island did not make this argument below and the Sixth Circuit did not pass upon it.  See &lt;em&gt;In re Vista-Pro Automotive, LLC&lt;/em&gt;, 109 F. 4th 438, 443 (2024) (“Coney Island does not mount a constitutional attack on Rule 60”).  In this Court, Coney Island expressly disclaimed any due process argument.  See Brief for Petitioner 22 (“To be clear, Coney Island does not contend that Rule 60 or Rule 60(c)(1) [is] unconstitutional”).  This Court does “not generally entertain arguments that were not raised below and are not advanced in this Court by any party.”  &lt;em&gt;Burwell&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/573/682"&gt;573 U. S. 682&lt;/a&gt;, 721 (2014).  There is no reason to depart from that practice absent unusual circumstances, which certainly are not present here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. 25–51. Decided January 26, 2026&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; Per Curiam&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), strict standards govern the grant of federal habeas relief to prisoners convicted in state court.  Faithful application of those standards sometimes puts federal district courts and courts of appeals in the disagreeable position of having to deny relief in cases they would have analyzed differently if they had been in the shoes of the relevant state court.  But federal courts are dutybound to comply with AEDPA, and we have granted summary relief when the lower courts have departed from the role AEDPA assigns.  See, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Clark&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Sweeney&lt;/em&gt;, 607 U. S. ___ (2025) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;); &lt;em&gt;Dunn&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Reeves&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/731"&gt;594 U. S. 731 (2021)&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;); &lt;em&gt;Mays&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Hines&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/592/385"&gt;592 U. S. 385 (2021)&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;); &lt;em&gt;Virginia&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;LeBlanc&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/582/91"&gt;582 U. S. 91 (2017)&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;); &lt;em&gt;White&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Wheeler&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/577/73"&gt;577 U. S. 73 (2015)&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This is such a case.  Respondent Charles Brandon Martin was convicted in a Maryland court for the attempted murder of one of his girlfriends, Jodi Torok.  The evidence against him was strong, his conviction was affirmed on appeal, and an appellate court held in a state postconviction proceeding that the State’s failure to disclose certain impeachment evidence that was favorable under &lt;em&gt;Brady &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Maryland&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/373/83"&gt;373 U. S. 83 (1963)&lt;/a&gt;, did not warrant a new trial because there was no “reasonable probability that the result of [the] trial would have been different” had the  evidence been turned over.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 115a (App.); see &lt;em&gt;Kyles &lt;/em&gt;v.&lt;em&gt; Whitley&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/514/419"&gt;514 U. S. 419&lt;/a&gt;, 434 (1995) (the “touchstone of materiality is a ‘reasonable probability’ of a different result”).  Because that decision neither was “contrary to” nor “involved an unreasonable application” of “clearly established Federal law,” AEDPA required the denial of Martin’s federal habeas petition.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2254#d_1"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1)&lt;/a&gt;.  Yet the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the award of a new trial based on reasoning that departed from what AEDPA prescribes.  We therefore grant the State’s petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: justify; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Torok, the victim of the attempted murder, had been dating Martin for about a year when she told him she was pregnant with a baby she thought was his.  Angered by this news, Martin demanded that Torok have an abortion.  She refused and informed him that she intended to go to court to compel him to provide child support.  She also threatened to tell his “wife or baby mama” about the child.  App. 254a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; A few weeks later, Martin sent Torok a text message asking: “ ‘What time do u work[?]’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;State&lt;/em&gt;, 218 Md. App. 1, 14, 96 A. 3d 765, 773 (2014) (alteration in original).  Torok replied, “ ‘I’m off [today],’ ” thus verifying that she would likely be home.  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;.  Later that day, just before 3 p.m., Torok was alone in her apartment in Crofton, Maryland, speaking on the phone with a close friend, Blair Wolfe, who lived in Pittsburgh.  During their call, a man purporting to be a salesman knocked on Torok’s front door.  Torok hung up to speak to the man but promised to call Wolfe back.  When she did not, Wolfe called her several times, but no one answered.  Growing increasingly concerned, Wolfe called Torok’s housemate, Jessica Higgs, and asked her to return home to see if Torok was safe.  Higgs found Torok unconscious on the floor, bleeding from a gunshot wound to  her head.  Torok survived, but her unborn baby did not, and Torok suffered serious permanent injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; When the police examined the scene of the shooting, they found no sign of forced entry and recovered several items of evidentiary value from the floor near where Torok lay: a shell casing and bullet from a .380-caliber cartridge and a peculiarly modified Gatorade bottle.  (Photos of this bottle appear in the appendix to this opinion.)  The upper part of the bottle was covered with two layers of tape, white medical tape underneath and silver duct tape on top.  There was a rectangular hole in the tape over the mouth of the bottle and a jagged hole at the bottom of the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Circumstantial evidence strongly suggested that this object was likely brought to the apartment and left there by Torok’s assailant.  Higgs testified that the bottle was not on the floor when she left for work that morning.  Both Torok and Higgs testified that they did not drink Gatorade or keep it at home, and both said that they would not have left a bottle on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The three items found at the crime scene played a part in the State’s case.  Federal firearms records showed that Martin owned a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun that could have fired the bullet and ejected the casing.  One of Martin’s girlfriends testified that she had seen him with a “small” “semiautomatic” gun in the weeks before the shooting.  App&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; 379a.  Michael Bradley, the brother of still another of Martin’s girlfriends, Maggie McFadden, added that on several occasions he had seen Martin with a “small” “semi-automatic gun.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 331a–333a, 371a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As for the bottle, the State offered evidence suggesting that it was a homemade silencer.  A police sergeant said that the tape on the mouth of the bottle bore a “rectangular impression” that likely resulted from something being “stuck in there.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 292a.  The bottle was available for examination by the jury, and the State argued that the opening in the tape was shaped like the muzzle of a  semiautomatic handgun.  The State also noted that the edges of the hole at the bottom of the bottle were bent outward, suggesting that the hole had been created by a force emanating from inside the bottle.  The police sergeant testified that the bottle resembled homemade silencing devices he had seen in a film and in online videos.  A detective testified that he found “black soot” inside the bottle, &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 310a–311a, but that he did not smell burnt or burning marijuana in the bottle, &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 314a–315a, and another witness testified that he found no “signs or evidence of controlled dangerous substances” in the bottle, &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 309.  Based on this evidence and the fact that none of Torok’s neighbors had heard a gunshot at the apartment on the afternoon of the shooting, the State argued that the bottle had been used as a silencer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Testing of the bottle revealed DNA evidence that strongly implicated Martin.  A hair was found on the tape on the bottle, and one of the State’s expert witnesses, a forensic scientist, determined that although the hair could not have come from 99.94 percent of the population of North America, she could not rule out Martin as the source of hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Besides the DNA taken from the hair, trace DNA from at least three persons, including at least one male, was found on the mouth of the bottle.  A forensic chemist testified that she could rule out 96 percent of the black population as potential sources of this DNA but could not rule out Martin (who is black).&lt;a href="#PERCURIAM_2-2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; This DNA evidence linking Martin to the bottle was bolstered by the testimony of Michael Bradley.  Bradley testified that on the afternoon of the shooting, he, his brother Frank, Martin, and an acquaintance named Jerry Burks smoked marijuana at McFadden’s home.  At one point, according to Michael, Frank went upstairs and came back with white “medical tape.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 337a.  Martin and Frank  then went upstairs together.  Frank came downstairs, grabbed a Gatorade bottle, and headed back up the stairs with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Based on this testimony, the State suggested that Martin helped to make the bottle into the silencing device that the shooter used.  This theory was supported by the discovery in the McFadden home of the same kind of white medical tape that was affixed to the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Michael Bradley further testified that Martin acted suspiciously at the time of and shortly after the shooting.  According to his testimony, Martin and Burks left the house together before 2 p.m. and were still out when he returned from picking up his niece at around 3 p.m.  Martin and Burks eventually reappeared together some time before 6:30 p.m.  Martin then handed Frank Bradley a “brown paper bag” and told him to “get rid of this.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 353a.  The State suggested that this bag contained the hit weapon, which was never found.  Neither did police ever find the .380-caliber pistol that, according to federal firearms records and witness testimony, Martin owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In addition to all this evidence, Sheri Carter, another of Martin’s girlfriends, testified for the State.  Carter said that Martin had kept at her home a laptop that he said he had obtained from a former employer.  She testified that she had seen Martin “looking up gun silencers” on this laptop not long before the shooting.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 377a.  Martin, she asserted, took the laptop from her apartment after the shooting and “got rid of it” “in case [the] apartment got searched,” because he “didn’t want it found there.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 378a–379a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The trial judge instructed the jury that Martin could be found guilty if he had “ ‘aided’ ” or “ ‘encouraged’ ” the attempted murder and assault with the intent that the crime succeed.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 79a.  The jury found him guilty as an accessory before the fact.  The court sentenced him to life in prison, and his conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.  &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt;, 218 Md. App. 1, 96 A. 3d 765.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt; B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Martin then sought postconviction relief in state court.  He argued that the State had violated his right to due process by failing to disclose a forensic report that had analyzed five computers found at his home.  One of these machines, a laptop, had been issued to Martin by a former employer.  The report found no evidence that this laptop had been used since 2005, and it noted that a keyword search for words such as “ ‘Handgun,’ ” “ ‘Gatorade,’ ” “ ‘silencer,’ ” and “ ‘Homemade silencer’ ” had yielded no hits.  App. 103a–104a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Martin argued that this computer was the one to which Carter had referred in her testimony and that the report tended to discredit her claim that he had used the laptop at her home to research silencers.  The postconviction court agreed and ordered a new trial, but a unanimous panel of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals reversed on the ground that the report was not material.  Based on its review of the whole record, the court concluded that even if the report had “totally discredit[ed]” Carter, the other evidence linking Martin to the crime was so “strong” that there was no “reasonable probability that the result of his trial would have been different.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 112a, 115a.  The State’s high court denied review, &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;State&lt;/em&gt;, 466 Md. 554, 222 A. 3d 1075 (2020) (table), as did this Court, see &lt;em&gt;Martin&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Maryland&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/590/973"&gt;590 U. S. 973 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;C&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Martin sought habeas relief in federal court, and the District Court granted his petition based on the State’s failure to disclose the forensic report.  A sharply divided panel of the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  The majority acknowledged that the state appellate court had correctly stated the rule on materiality set out in our decisions and had claimed to apply that rule.  Yet the majority concluded that the state court had not actually done what it said it did—had not held  that there was no “reasonable probability” that the disclosure of the forensic report would have changed the verdict—but instead had applied the sufficiency-of-the-evidence rule that we condemned in &lt;em&gt;Kyles&lt;/em&gt;.  App. 21a–22a; see 514 U. S., at 434–435&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(a &lt;em&gt;Brady&lt;/em&gt; claimant need not show that, “after discounting the inculpatory evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, there would not have been enough left to convict”).  According to the majority, the state court “never engaged” with some evidence, “disregarded or misconstrued” other evidence, and failed to assess in a “nuanced” way the evidence it did discuss.  App. 24a–26a.  The majority then ruled that no fairminded jurist could agree with the state court’s decision.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 27a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Judge Niemeyer dissented, contending that the majority had defied AEDPA’s standard of review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: justify; text-align: center;"&gt;A&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; As we have noted many times, AEDPA sharply limits federal review of habeas claims raised by state prisoners.  A federal court may grant habeas relief on a claim that a state court resolved on the merits only when the state court’s “decision” was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,” or “was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented” in state court.  &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2254#d"&gt;28 U. S. C. §2254(d)&lt;/a&gt;.  These standards require federal courts to give the “benefit of the doubt” to merits decisions issued by the courts of the sovereign States.  &lt;em&gt;Woodford&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Visciotti&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/537/19"&gt;537 U. S. 19&lt;/a&gt;, 24 (2002) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;).  AEDPA review provides an important but limited safeguard: It protects against “ ‘extreme malfunctions’ ” in the state courts’ adjudication of constitutional claims.  &lt;em&gt;Harrington&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Richter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/86"&gt;562 U. S. 86&lt;/a&gt;, 102 (2011).  So in order to obtain federal habeas relief, a state prisoner must “show far more” than “ ‘clear error.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Shinn&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Kayer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/592/111"&gt;592 U. S. 111&lt;/a&gt;, 118 (2020) (&lt;em&gt;per curiam&lt;/em&gt;) (quoting &lt;em&gt;LeBlanc&lt;/em&gt;,  582 U. S., at 94).  The habeas claimant must instead establish that the state court “blunder[ed] so badly that every fairminded jurist would disagree” with the decision.  &lt;em&gt;Mays&lt;/em&gt;, 592 U. S., at 392.  Only then is a decision “so lacking in justification” that its error precludes even the “possibility for fairminded” dispute.  &lt;em&gt;Richter&lt;/em&gt;, 562 U. S., at 103.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; “If this rule means anything,” we have said, it means that a federal court must “carefully consider all the reasons and evidence supporting the state court’s decision.”  &lt;em&gt;Mays&lt;/em&gt;, 592 U. S., at 391.  That requirement is pivotal because federal courts have “no authority to impose mandatory opinion-writing standards on state courts.”  &lt;em&gt;Johnson&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Williams&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/289"&gt;568 U. S. 289&lt;/a&gt;, 300 (2013).  And a state court “need not make detailed findings addressing all the evidence before it.”  &lt;em&gt;Miller-El&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Cockrell&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/537/322"&gt;537 U. S. 322&lt;/a&gt;, 347 (2003).  Indeed, AEDPA requires deference even if the state court does not discuss the evidence at all.  &lt;em&gt;Richter&lt;/em&gt;, 562 U. S., at 99.  What matters under §2254(d)(1)—the standard relevant here—is whether a decision is contrary to, or involves an unreasonable application of, this Court’s holdings, not whether the state court’s opinion satisfies the federal court’s opinion-writing standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The panel majority contravened these well-settled principles in two ways.  First, it grounded its holding that the state appellate court applied the wrong legal rule on its conclusion that the state court had not actually applied the materiality test that it clearly invoked.  Second, it erred in holding that no fairminded jurist could find the forensic report on the computer to be immaterial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The panel majority first erred in holding that the state appellate court failed to apply the right rule for &lt;em&gt;Brady&lt;/em&gt; materiality.  Undisclosed evidence is material if it could  reasonably have “ ‘put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Strickler &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;Greene&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/527/263"&gt;527 U. S. 263&lt;/a&gt;, 290 (1999).  But when the evidence could not have reasonably had such an effect, it is not material, and its erroneous nondisclosure does not justify relief.  Under this rule, even if undisclosed evidence “entirely discredit[s]” a prosecution witness, the failure to turn over the evidence is not material if “considerable” other evidence “link[s]” the defendant to the crime and the record provides “strong support” that the defendant would have been convicted anyway.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 292–294.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The state appellate court applied these rules instead of a sufficiency-of-the-evidence test.  The state court accurately summarized our &lt;em&gt;Brady&lt;/em&gt; precedents, correctly stated the governing rule on materiality, and stated unequivocally that its decision was based on that rule.  It recounted salient trial evidence, acknowledged where the State’s theory of the case was “attenuated,” and said that the disclosure of the forensic report would likely have eliminated any adverse inference based on the concealment of evidence.  App. 114a–115a, and n. 14.  It also assumed that the jury would have “totally discredit[ed]” Carter’s testimony had the State disclosed the report.  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 112a.  Yet based on its review of the “ ‘entire record,’ ” the court found that the evidence “linking” Martin to the crime was so “strong” that there was no “reasonable probability that the result of his trial would have been different.”  &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;., at 109a–110a, 112a, 115a.  That standard was legally correct.  And except when it was quoting our precedent, the state court did not use words like “sufficient,” “insufficient,” “adequate,” or “inadequate” in analyzing the &lt;em&gt;Brady&lt;/em&gt; claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The panel majority nonetheless held that the state appellate court applied the wrong rule because that court failed to discuss certain evidence that tended to undermine the State’s case and because its analysis was not sufficiently “nuanced.”  App. 24a–26a.  That holding was a basic  misapplication of AEDPA, which bars federal courts from imposing opinion-writing standards on state courts and demands that the relevant state-court decision be given the “benefit of the doubt.”  &lt;em&gt;Woodford&lt;/em&gt;, 537 U. S., at 24.  The majority’s “readiness to attribute error” to the state appellate court despite that court’s correct citation and synthesis of our precedent was both “inconsistent with the presumption that state courts know and follow the law” and “incompatible with §2254(d)’s ‘highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings.’ ”  &lt;em&gt;Ibid&lt;/em&gt;. (quoting &lt;em&gt;Lindh&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em&gt;Murphy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/521/320"&gt;521 U. S. 320&lt;/a&gt;, 333, n. 7 (1997)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: justify; text-align: center;"&gt;a&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The panel majority also went astray in holding that every fairminded jurist would find that the undisclosed forensic report about Martin’s laptop was material.  On the contrary, the record contains “strong support” for the state court’s conclusion that Martin “would have been convicted” even if the forensic report “severely impeached” Carter.  &lt;em&gt;Strickler&lt;/em&gt;, 527 U. S., at 294.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; DNA evidence tied Martin tightly to the modified Gatorade bottled that resembled a homemade silencer and that had apparently been used in the shooting.  Evidence also suggested that Martin was present when the bottle was modified.  Michael Bradley testified that shortly before the shooting Martin was in the room to which Frank Bradley brought both a Gatorade bottle and tape that matched the white medical tape on the mouth of the bottle found at the crime scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Martin had a strong motive for aiding the attempted murder of Torok: She had refused to get an abortion, had expressed her intent to take him to court to obtain child support, and had threatened to tell his wife about the baby.  On the day of the shooting, Martin had texted Torok in  what a reasonable jury could think was an effort to find a time when she would be home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Martin owned the kind of gun that seemed to have been used to shoot Torok, and multiple witnesses testified that they had seen him with such a weapon.  Michael Bradley also testified that Martin left McFadden’s house not long before the hit and that, upon returning, Martin told Frank Bradley to get rid of a brown paper bag that Martin had been holding.  Because the police never found Martin’s handgun or the weapon used in the shooting, a reasonable jury might well have concluded that Martin allowed his gun to be used and then ensured its disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; In light of all this evidence, a fairminded jurist could easily conclude that the disclosure of the forensic report on the computer would not have “undercut” the relevance or force of these “item[s] of the State’s case,” &lt;em&gt;Kyles&lt;/em&gt;, 514 U. S., at 451, or “ ‘put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict,’ ” &lt;em&gt;Strickler&lt;/em&gt;, 527 U. S., at 290.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;b&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The panel majority’s reasons for concluding otherwise were not consistent with the deference that AEDPA requires.  First, the majority argued that the disclosure of the report would have bolstered the defense’s primary theory of the case: that the bottle was a device used to smoke marijuana, not a silencer.  But a fairminded jurist could find that theory farfetched.  Among other things, the mouth of the bottle was covered in tape that looked like it had nestled the muzzle of a semiautomatic firearm.  The bottle did not smell like burnt marijuana and bore no trace of controlled substances.  The outward-punched puncture at the bottom of the bottle also looked like a bullet hole, and the defense never explained why anyone wanting to construct a bong would have poked a hole in the bottom of the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The panel majority ventured that Carter’s testimony was the “only evidence connecting Martin to his potential  construction of the Gatorade bottle for use as a silencer.”  App. 21a.  A fairminded jurist could easily disagree based on both the bottle itself and Michael Bradley’s eyewitness testimony about what had occurred upstairs in the McFadden house shortly before the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; The panel majority discounted the strength of the evidence against Martin because it thought that strong evidence linked McFadden to the commission of the crime.  Yet that theory was inconsistent with the undisputed testimony that Torok ended her phone call with Wolfe to speak with a man who was at the door.  Nor did any evidence tie McFadden to the Gatorade bottle or the disposal of the firearm.  And even if McFadden were somehow involved in the crime, Martin could have been an accessory anyway.  After all, a fairminded jurist could decide that no evidence suggests that McFadden knew about Torok, or had any reason to want her killed, except through and because of Martin.  See &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;., at 439a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Last, the panel majority voiced serious doubt about Michael Bradley’s credibility, and the defense certainly had material to use in its effort to convince the jury that he should not be believed.  But his testimony about Martin’s role in the creation of the makeshift silencer was supported by the DNA evidence, and the jury was able to assess his credibility firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; Based on all the evidence, a fairminded jurist could easily conclude that disclosure of the forensic report on the laptop would not have made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt; We grant the State’s petition for a writ of certiorari, reverse the judgment of the Fourth Circuit, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;It is so ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Justice Jackson&lt;/span&gt; would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; text-align: center;"&gt; APPENDIX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; text-align: justify;"&gt;App. 442a &lt;/p&gt;
